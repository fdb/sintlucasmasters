The History of Why is a project where I explore the forgotten and lost stories about jewellery.    I dive into the history of the symbolism used in jewellery and I reintroduce these stories to a contemporary audience.

The History of Why: A love letter to the unlucky opal. Is a project where I explore the forgotten and lost stories about the opal. The opal has always been known for its exquisite beauty admired by many throughout time. Its rarity is based on the magnificent play of colors on its surface. This is just one of the reasons why it is so cherished. But yet this mineral is riddled with superstition. What’s the origin of this superstition? Why is an opal considered to be unlucky? In this project I have examined its rich history in search of the answers.
