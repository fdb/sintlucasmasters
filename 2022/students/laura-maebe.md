A fashion collection based on your preferences and personality.

Fast fashion is a huge problem within the fashion industry. Cheap clothing that is usually thrown away within a year due to the poor quality. This has to stop and fashion on demand is a good solution for this. Personalized clothing lasts longer because people value it more because it is made especially for them. This is why I present to you my fashion collection: You by Laura Maebe. A fashion collection based on your preferences and personality.

On the website you take a test that determines your basic design. The test looks at your preferences and personality. After this you can adjust your design yourself so that you have a completely unique design. This design is then embroidered on a garment however you want. Central in the middle? Or just not? Very big, or just very small? Everything is possible!
