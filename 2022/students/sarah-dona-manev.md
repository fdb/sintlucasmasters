bio: My interests are characterized by the relationship between the world of the
  individual or object and the physical space they occupy. The last few years I
  have studied psychoanalysis and the way in which it deals with different forms
  of storytelling. Classically, psychoanalysis brings subconscious thoughts and
  feelings into the conscious to encourage ‘freely associating’ with dreams. In
  my work I aim to create images that inspire that same free association, for
  myself and others. I often make use of video, sound and installation to create
  stage images (that conjure up the subconscious). Every new work is an inward
  investigation. In this way I try to make myself understood and connect to the
  world around me.

‘Invited by the rope’ is a work by Sarah-Dona Manev. It is at once an installation and a soundscape that invites the viewer to unravel. Firstly, to unravel the rope itself and by doing so perhaps their story, or any story. The act of unravelling makes the rope grow longer. As more viewers unravel the fabric together, the stories grow and become inextricably intertwined.
