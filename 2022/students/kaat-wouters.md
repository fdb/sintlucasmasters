  Previous year, I had the need to go outside more and create art in and with
  nature. Before that, I kept myself inside and worked all these years on
  drawings and paintings. 

  I loved making those but I was never fully satisfied with my proces and that's when the worm started to speak to me.

The worm was a being that kept coming back in my paintings and drawings and first, it was just a character like the others but after a while it became more personal. It started to speak to me in different ways. It brought me outside, where I made his habitat but also my new comfortable space to work in. I experimented with different natural materials and created natural pigments and grasspaper.
