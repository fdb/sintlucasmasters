Ethereal Matter consists of several generative works that explore the notion of digital materiality through passing digital experiences, artifacts and computational co-creation. The estranged ethereal characteristics of the immaterial, yet seemingly tangible and constantly changing nature of the work, places it somewhere in between our sensory fields of perception. Somewhere between the formal and the abstract, the artificial and the natural. A representation of a certain digital ethereal materiality that allows us to reflect on the relationship with our digital environments and the importance of the materialized traces it leaves behind.
