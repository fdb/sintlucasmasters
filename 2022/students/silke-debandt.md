My client simply couldn't contain himself. This work addresses the impunity of sexual violence in Belgium. Prints taken from original court documents are adapted by embroidery, felting and writing. Art is a form of self-expression to me and therefore I want to make my voice heard through my work and explore how art can be a medium to address political issues.
