Typography has an impact on our daily life. What is the impact of fonts on a social construct? A typographic exploration of how type affects our impressions of the world, authority, and trust.

Craig Warde once expressed it: good typography is invisible bad typography is everywhere. A Safe Space for Bad Type is a typographic investigation on the impact of type on our perceptions of the world, authority, and trust. There are at least 500,000 different fonts available today. What factors influence our decision to use a certain font in a given situation? Fonts can be thought of as a tool for displaying your emotions, status, and tone of voice. This study takes it a step further by attempting to demonstrate it through the reversal and misuse of social conceptions.
