The project explores the search for a personal identity through a created visual language that is based on the heritage of the designer and the patterns of middle eastern carpets. Each Middle Eastern rug tells a story, through the meanings of the different motifs on the carpet but Gümüs plays with the shapes and colours without having to attach great significance to them. She leaves out the meanings or the stories of the motifs, when she is designing new shapes. But afterwards she names her works with the name of the shape she started from.
