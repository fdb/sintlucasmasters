  Anouk Beckers, Digital Product Designer


  I'm fascinated by how things work and how people think. I love writing, creative thinking and solving design problems.

Concept & UX design of an app with audiobooks for children. 

Children are turning their backs on written word. The next generation is only interested in fast paced, interactive content and books don't fit the bill. Because of this a lot of beautiful stories with valuable life lessons, are now out of reach. By letting children listen to these stories on their trusted tablet, I want to reconnect them with literature. Audio Octo provides the ultimate listening experience for children: every story is narrated by a professional storyteller and with the 8D audio technology, children can truly experience the story.
