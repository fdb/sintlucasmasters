bio: >
  I research systems of books. While organising my own book and looking at other
  books I’m intrigued by ways to challenge the static characteristics of the
  medium.


  I enjoy finding a way to present my research digitally. You can check out my processfolio via the following link —>

  It was made to look at from desktop, not mobile.
