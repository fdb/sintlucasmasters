bio: >-
  I'm Fien a digital context masterstudent with a love for architecture and
  anything geometric. 


  For my masterproject I created ArchiVox. ArchiVox is a project in which I explored what architecture would look like, were you to loosen its function. With research into the relationship between 2D and 3D, utopian architecture and the creation of its own digital language system, structures and compositions were created.

ArchiVox is a project in which I explored what architecture would look like, were you to loosen its function. With research into the relationship between 2D and 3D, utopian architecture and the creation of its own digital language system, structures and compositions were created.

I started my masterproject with experiments in 2D, I made a system through code to form patterned images. They were a bit like a floor plan. The relationship with utopian architecture has never been far away, the full potential of this is underestimated and I started to look at this in research. Afterwards I shifted my focus to utopian architecture in 3D and started building my own system with three.js where, by means of voxels and specific commands, one could create one's own architecture and structure.

The process was made visible through a self-coded website that grew organically over the year. At the end I adjusted some elements and made it a bit more organized. The link to this page is the following, <https://masterpagearchivox.netlify.app/> . I chose this approach as it fits the master context I chose and it was a good exercise in keeping a website up to date. I also kept a Notion page where everything was put in draft before it appeared on the website. The work is presented both digitally and in print. The website process folio and the tool of the created language are presented digitally. Besides that there are A4 prints of compositions and structures that can be made.
