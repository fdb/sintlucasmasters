bio: Gloriya Avgust’s multidisciplinary practice explores the interplay between
  the social, physical and sensible spaces that inhabit us. Borrowing language
  from daily encounters – from content found online to everyday social
  interactions – she seeks to engage personal experiences that are fundamental
  facets of our selfhood. Her writing often pours over into other mediums in the
  forms of drawings, objects and performances, multiplying into myriad
  reflective surfaces in which we might recognize ourselves and our place in the
  world.

*Loose ends hiding in kitchen drawers* is a performance which guides the audience into a non-linear narration that unfolds a self, situated in the crevice between the pressing body of memory and a yearning that continuously flexes its course.
