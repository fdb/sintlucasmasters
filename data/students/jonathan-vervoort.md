  Everywhere we go, whether it is online or offline, there is no escape from
  possible image seduction. The more visual stimulation we get, the less time we
  take to individually look at images. Yet, each one of them desperately vies
  for our attention. My painterly practice employs the inexhaustible stream of
  images constantly imposed upon us by our hyper-capitalized world. It reflects
  on the current state of contemporary image culture, questioning the value of
  image and using it as a means to propose a critique.
