bio: I did my bachelor in studio kunst painting at Sint Lucas Antwerpen. But my
  practice is multidisciplinary. I am working on the subject of temporality
  which is a reality of our life. Natural elements as one my material, I
  experiment with different objects and methods to highlight the change with
  poetry.

From our deepest memory to the distant mountain are all subject to change. It is my attempt to translate my observation of the unresolvable and the ephemeral. I hope to create a space where public can experience silence and calmness, similar to what I feel while creating these works.
