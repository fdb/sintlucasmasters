  Hi, I'm Michelle Maes 


  I graduated last year in graphic design. In my master project this year I wanted to learn more about the digital side of designing. That's why I chose the digital master. I started looking at generative design as a starting point for my project.  


  Now this is my final result. Hope you like it!
