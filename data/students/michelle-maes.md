  Hi, I'm Michelle Maes 


  I graduated last year in graphic design. In my master project this year I
  wanted to learn more about the digital side of designing. That's why I chose
  the digital master. I started looking at generative design as a starting point
  for my project.  


  Now this is my final result. Hope you like it!

These patterns became the base of my project and I started combining them with my background in child care and graphic design. By doing so, I ended up creating a spatial experience for children to relax and calm down, using an artistic approach
