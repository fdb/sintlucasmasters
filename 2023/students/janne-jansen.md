Fungi will play a crucial role in shaping our future lives, as they have been for billions of years. However, their role is often overlooked. The installation "Molding Matters” guides you through a critical conversation about this vital relationship from a fungal perspective. It aims to ignite a sense of empathy and curiosity within you, encouraging a deeper understanding of this largely enigmatic species. 

Fungi will play a fundamental role in shaping our future lives, just as they have done for billions of years. However, their significance is often overlooked, despite their prominent position within our ecosystem. The concept of the 'Symbioceen' represents a new era where humans, nature, and technology coexist in a balanced symbiotic relationship. This philosophy serves as the foundation for this project, aiming to transform our current relationship with fungi.
In the installation Molding Matters, you are guided through a critical conversation that explores the crucial bond within this relationship from a fungal perspective. This is done by drawing parallels between well-known questions pertaining to human love relationships and the connection we, as humans, have with fungi. Through this conversation, you gradually gain a deeper understanding of these beautiful organisms. Ultimately, you have the opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to this relationship by placing mycelium on the wall and actively contributing to ‘mold’ our surroundings. Molding Matters aims to evoke a sense of empathy and curiosity within you, fostering a profound appreciation for this largely mysterious species.
