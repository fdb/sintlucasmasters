"Obsidian" is a graphic novel that follows a young girl's journey to confront her inner demons and shadow self, inspired by Jungian psychology. Through her struggles, the story explores the theme of shadow work and the importance of self-awareness and growth.

Obsidian is a graphic novel created as part of Hanne’s master project. 
The story follows a young girl as she struggles with self-doubt, hatred, fears due to past mistakes and experiences. A lurking shadow figure that seems to be watching her every move. When she decides to confront this shadow, she discovers that the shadow is actually a part of herself that she has never been able to accept.
This graphic novel draws inspiration from Carl Gustav Jung's studies on the shadow and unconscious mind. The story is based on the author's personal thoughts, feelings, and struggles that she learned to understand by participating in shadow work herself.
Through the protagonist's journey, the graphic novel explores the theme of shadow work and encourages readers to confront their own inner shadow with empathy and understanding in order to achieve greater self-awareness and growth. 
Hanne chose this subject because she believes that shadow work deserves more attention, since she feels that it’s a practice that can have a positive impact on most peoples lives.
