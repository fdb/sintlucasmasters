Only by experiencing dissociation, one can become an individual.<br>
Only by realizing isolation, one can apprehend existence.<br>
Only by accepting actuality, one can mature in subsisting.<br>
Only by reaching the ground, one can relate to everyone.<br>

When the head fell to the ground, more questions were raised up to the sky.<br>
The decapitation of the head that took place by the Antwerp Opera in 2022 was not the end. It was a spontaneous, intuitive move that was merely a starting point of a phase of self-reflection. The second phase will be an exploration of the dissociated head, and its urge to tell its story of aggravation, restraint and confusion. But the answers remain unclear, so we shall seeâ€¦
