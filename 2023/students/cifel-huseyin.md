Humans have senses to communicate with their surroundings.

Spaces have dimensions to communicate with their passers-by.

An artistic exploration that aims to visually investigate artistic methods and processes of revealing extended visual qualities of mental space, and what type of connections are intertwined within its architectonic surroundings...

The built environment is frequently used to present and illustrate the idea of spatial context. Its primary function is to aid in the comprehension of the realm of various experiences and reality-based perspectives. These influences that occupy the mode of being experienced, felt, and perceived to create knowledge intersect in areas where time's notion expresses intricate reflections of itself in relation to events, entities, objects, phenomena, or material items. These procedures play a crucial role in showcasing spaces with their intricate, enigmatic, and obscure depth from an inclusive or expansive perspective. In other words, in addition to the inherent physicality, events that arise spatially in built environments have a wealth of other, hidden characteristics. It is necessary to develop unconventional thinking techniques that would reconstruct how spaces are perceived individually in order to be able to reveal these qualities. It is possible to discover special hidden dimensions that deepen our understanding of the entirety of the phenomena related to spaces and their surroundings by investigating the spatial context in a non-linear timeline. These embodiments serve as the framework for this artistic exploration, which aims to visually investigate artistic methods and processes for revealing extended visual qualities of mental space and what kinds of connections are entwined within its architectonic surroundings.
