What happens when you combine the empirical reality of the climate crisis with the profound dogmas and organizational framework of a religion. By intertwining science and spirituality, this project aims to bring the urgent need for attention and unwavering dedication to the climate crisis in a new light.

This project started form a genuine concern for our planet and a passion to reshape the climate discourse, infusing it with humour and presenting a fresh perspective, giving birth to the Church of Climate.

This new religion is brought to life through a set of artefacts. First and foremost, the holy scriptures namely: The Green Gospel, a collection of parables, instructions on how to live a climatist life, relics and more. These elements are all gathered into small booklets and screen-printed posters to make up the scriptures of climatism.

Furthermore, there is a set of paintings depicting apocalyptic scenarios and ecological hellscapes. These were made from carefully crafted ai-generated images, turned into collages in Photoshop.

In a final step, a place of worship was designed to encapsulate the core values and principles at the heart of the Church, standing as a tangible representation of their faith. For this church a 2D image was made that was later transformed into a 3D model to complete the collection of artefacts.
