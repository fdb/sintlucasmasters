R.A.V.E is an audiovisual exploration and music event. Showcasing an evening of electronic music curated by GRID inside S.M.A.K museum. This event doubles as a co-creation for an audiovisual art piece by designer and master student and researcher Lars Hiele. Giving guests not only the ability to experience a night of music inside the art institute but also be a part of a new work. The project researches new ways to reach a new young audience by making subcultures collide with the museum.

The project researches new ways to reach a new young audience by making subcultures collide with the museum. R.A.V.E. attempts to make a first time connection with ‘first timers’ to invite them to discover museum spaces in a different light. As a secondary objective we question what can take place in a museum and how we can use the art institute to recognise subcultures as culturally significant
