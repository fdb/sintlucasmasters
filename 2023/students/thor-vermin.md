"Het Atelier" consists of two video projections that display two perspectives of the same moment in space: one view towards two broken windows and the other towards the opposite wall. The room is depicted with a day and night cycle, and over the course of six hours, subtle shifts in light, color, and atmosphere transform the spirit of the room. 

"Het Atelier" consists of two video projections that display two perspectives of the same moment in space: one view towards two broken windows and the other towards the opposite wall. The room is depicted with a day and night cycle, and over the course of six hours, subtle shifts in light, color, and atmosphere transform the spirit of the room. 

Two virtual cameras, while invisible, offer a window into an isolated space, capturing its essence. The room itself carries a historical connection with the camera, acting as a witness to past events and further deepening the connection between the physical and mental space. 

"Het Atelier", with its six hour run time, evokes an awareness of the passage of time, encouraging viewers to slow down and embrace stillness.
