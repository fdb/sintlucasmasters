In an era of technology and anthropocentrism, far from my birthplace, the work represents a personal reconnection, a memory of the coniferous forests of Romania.

In an era of technology and anthropocentrism, blinded by daily stimuli, far from my birthplace, where nature was my home, the longing for the natural environment appeared. Thus, the work represents a personal reconnection, a memory of what I have been surrounded by for a long time, the coniferous forests of Romania. The work seeks to capture the essence of a journey bringing back my roots.
