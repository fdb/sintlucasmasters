A machine is more than just an object. It has a dimension that asserts itself upon human contact. It relates to the definition of an artefact as an object from a specific period that provides information about that exact period. In other words, to comprehend our days, we must analyse our surrounding objects. Every machine we bring into our private sphere must be dissected, along with all the body parts it shapes.
