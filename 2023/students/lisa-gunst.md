Oscar Wilde, the Irish playwright and poet, is still relatively well known today.
Most people, however, stop at “writer” and “dandy” when trying to describe him.
For eight months, I have researched every corner of his life, and given that research a physical form.
This project is an ode from me to Oscar, it will not pretend to be anything more complete or less ardent than that.

For eight months, I have been reading about his life and gotten to know him better.
