Transformations in the urban environment are constantly present in our daily lives, often going unnoticed, particularly when they happen gradually. However, when these changes start to restrict our freedom and diminish the availability of public spaces within the city, they have significant repercussions on our behaviour and the dynamics of our relationships with others.

Transformations in the urban environment are constantly present in our daily lives, often going unnoticed, particularly when they happen gradually. However, when these changes start to restrict our freedom and diminish the availability of public spaces within the city, they have significant repercussions on our behaviour and the dynamics of our relationships with others. The augmented reality viewer to be used in this space next to the entrance will transport spectators to a place apparently not very different from the real one: in fact, they will be able to look around and notice a 3D environment that initially wants to reproduce exactly the one in which they they really are in the physical world. Although in the same space, spectators will in fact find themselves a few meters away, but in a space that is in fact private and normally inaccessible. Gradually your surroundings will begin to change. The idea of creating such a site-specific installation is once again to emphasize the fact that we often don't realize the changes that gradually take place around us in the streets we cross every day. Instead, the change of space in the animation in the virtual environment intentionally conveys a slight sense of anxiety and claustrophobia, trying to suggest the idea of being gradually more limited in a space.
