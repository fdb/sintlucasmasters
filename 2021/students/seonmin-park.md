bio: >-
  I never had the identity as an Asian. I was only female. Since I moved to
  Europe I became "Asian" and "woman".   The extra tag led me to face racial
  problems. Asian women are submissive and voiceless. Asian men are forever
  asexual. But am I? Are we? 


  There are many discourses over racial issues these days but Asians have always
  been marginalized in the topic. The way the West illustrates the East has not
  been changed for centuries. It is not even problematic. It is just regarded 
  as "cliche".

"*Welcome. Bite, chew, taste and digest the unordered/misordered menu*."

 My project talks about orientalism including objectification. I expose the Western gaze and colonial gaze by appropriating orientalist elements and converting them as sarcasm.
