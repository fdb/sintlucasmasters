A plot of land, fifteen by fifteen meters, a blank canvas to start or not really blank it had already a shape, a place, a system, a context. So how to work with these givens? 

\-

Consulting, doubting, more consulting, doubting \
Discussing, arguing, just starting \
Digging, stabbing, spitting, turning, flipping and shaping. 

\-

Waiting 

\-

Waiting 

\-

Looking, feeling, thinking, lying down, standing up. Warmth dripping from the glass. \
Through the condensation I see people passing by.\
A smell of green, tropical I would say. 

\-

They tell me stories, all their stories, we tell each other stories. 

\-

When I move, it’s recorded, when you move, you are recorded, when things move, it will always be recorded. Is it a battle or a dialogue? 

\-

White roots that hide underneath the grass, \
*emelten*, these legless, grey-brown tube-shaped larvae,\
 rocks that obstruct your way while you dig.  Shall I go around it or work with it? Can I decide what stays or goes? 

\-

From A to B, to Z. Back to A, back to 3, going to minus 1, up to level 6 pursuing to a degree, failing, persisting, falling, crawling, jumping, spinning, turning, the bright sun on my back, taut skin, tightening the abdominal muscle, applying power from the back, kneeling, stooping and standing up again.
