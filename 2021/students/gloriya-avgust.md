  Gloriya Avgust’s multidisciplinary practice explores the interplay between the
  social, physical and sensible spaces that inhabit us. Borrowing language from
  daily encounters – from content found online to everyday social interactions –
  she seeks to engage personal experiences that are fundamental facets of our
  selfhood. Her writing often pours over into other mediums in the forms of
  drawings, objects and performances, multiplying into myriad reflective
  surfaces in which we might recognize ourselves and our place in the world.

*Loose ends hiding in kitchen drawers* is a performance which guides the audience into a non-linear narration that unfolds a self, situated in the crevice between the pressing body of memory and a yearning that continuously flexes its course.
