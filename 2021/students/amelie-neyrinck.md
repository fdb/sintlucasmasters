bio: >-
  I am a graphic design student who's main interest lies within branding. With
  my designs I focus on minimalism, unique typography and bold colors. I often
  take an activist approach within my work, where I point out certain issues
  within our society that I want to highlight.

What if branding was honest? Companies often misuse branding to hide unethical practices, in order to win over the general public. 'Brandtopia' is a manifesto that calls that into question by giving 3 unethical brands an honest re-branding. The companies in question are; BP, FN Herstal and Nestl√©.
