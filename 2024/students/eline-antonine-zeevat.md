A multidisciplinary installation, consisting of three components: girlhood glitches, gender whispers, and etched allegories. This installation visualizes my exploration of and within hierarchical systems, gender biases and societal blueprints.

My current work rests at the intersection of structures I inhabit and consecutively perform whilst I’m far from actually understanding them, being a ‘meisje, droom jij maar verder’. It’s a battle I fight daily; the idea that my female voice is unnecessary. It alienates as if we speak different languages.

With this constant in mind, I reflect on the structures entwined in me, close to me, part of the system I’m in. I display this in an installation that visualizes my analysis of experiences in everyday life, as well as in academic and cultural institutions as a woman, artist and female artist. An exploration of how patriarchal and dominated structures influence my perspective and position.

This feeling of being directed/influenced/manipulated is an everyday impact that I incorporate into this work, combined with feminist ideology. The materials, such as the suspended ceiling and construction drawings, are often associated with male-dominated environments. By using them within an artistic context, I appropriate, (misuse/) use them, and initiate a dialogue about their values, with the idea that they symbolize something greater: the deconstruction of a flawed system.

The combination of these objects and works—the hanging etching plates as transparent curtains, visible and invisible depending on where you stand, the ceiling, and the animation—together form a poetic image that does not explain my research but makes it felt. These are my drafts of blueprints of my own deconstructed space.
