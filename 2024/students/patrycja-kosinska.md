Fishboy is a story about Bo, a despondent man who consistently encounters failure in his uninteresting life. The story unfolds when he meets a homeless person after a failed attempt at ending his own life.  

"Fishboy" is a short graphic novel about the life of Bo, a miserable individual who attempts to end his own life but fails. Crying on the way back home, he crashes into a homeless person. The two befriend one another, and Bo decides to challenge himself once again. After a week, he'll try again, this time successfully. Or so he hopes.

During his one-week journey, Bo discovers absolutely nothing about himself. Despite his efforts, he realizes he's just not made for it. Even after his failed attempt, everything seems to remain the same. Everyday he wakes up to the same alarm sound and everyday his life seems to remain grey. Bo continues to deal with his feelings, anxiety, friends, work... and therapists?
