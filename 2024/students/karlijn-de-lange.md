This project explores the deserts of the United States through both personal and fictional narratives that utilize the landscape as a (film)set. Between the works, there is a cross-referencing of symbiotic parallels between the personal and fictional. The landscape has been reconstructed through lenses of popular visual culture, satellites and personal footage. These different lenses allow for revisiting the landscape from afar and with a closer attention to detail.

This project explores the deserts of the southwest United States through both personal and fictional narratives that utilize the landscape as a (film)set. Between the works, there is a cross-referencing of symbiotic parallels between the personal and fictional. A number of fictional narratives are captured through screenshots of popular visual culture - and made in to a book - as a visualization of how this desert is being represented and reproduced widely. One particular representation is the main reference for the painting “Bone County”, namely the game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. The map of the game dictates the composition of the painting, whilst incorporating satellite footage of the real area that the game is based on. Besides the painting, some of the drawings in this project also reflect the landscape through the aerial point of view. It is a perspective in which the connection between the different components of the landscape become visible, similarly to a map. Both the painting and drawings have reconstructed the landscape through lenses of popular visual culture, satellites and personal footage. These different lenses allow for revisiting the landscape without physically being there. Revisiting in this way allows for a closer attention to detail of the landscape, which is not possible in the same way through fragmented interactions. It is a way of slowing down and reconstructing a memory of a place.
