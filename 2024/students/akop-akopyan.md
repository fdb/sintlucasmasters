An anthology of modern folk tales reimagined by a group of people navigating the space between two cultures. We infused these stories with our personal fantasies, traumas, and desires. This collection captures our unique perspectives, shaped by a blend of cultural influences. Each tale offers a nonlinear journey through our collective imagination.
