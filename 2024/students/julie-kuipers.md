I FEEL...' bridges hearts, igniting deep conversations between parents and children. Poetic illustrations and themes drawn from life's complexities invite exploration and growth. Each of the seven chapters delves into a different emotion, transforming feelings into opportunities for connection and understanding.

"I FEEL..." is not just a book; it's a bridge between hearts, a spark for vital conversations between parents and children. Emotions, complex and often elusive, find a voice here. With each page, understanding deepens, and empathy flourishes.

The evocative illustrations invite shared interpretation, a dance of colors and feelings. Each chapter, inspired by the seven sins, transforms them into opportunities for reflection and growth, challenging the guilt tied to stereotypical norms.

In this journey, parents and children explore their emotions, weaving stories and strengthening their bond. "I FEEL..." is a gentle guide, encouraging the embrace of all feelings with compassion, fostering resilience, and nurturing the tender connections that bind us.
