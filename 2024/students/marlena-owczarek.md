I am merely rephrasing what has been said, translating it into (un)readable visual form.  Fragmented and reassembled, transforming fleeting visions into tanglible objects.
These pieces represent a reverie where I consciously enter the unconscious, losing myself in the process. 

A journey into my individual experience, reconnecting with universal subconscious symbols. By observing my surroundings and researching meaning, I focus on personal development, reworking age-old symbols into my drawings. The result is an artwork reflecting on personal evolution through an alchemical process, offering recognisable yet sometimes unreadable imagery.
