Brand identity for startup fashion 
designer Annaëlle. 

For my master's project, I collaborated with startup fashion designer Annaëlle. I designed her brand identity, including her logo, clothing tag, invitation, and collection book for her third bachelor collection. Annaëlle's BA3 collection draws inspiration from the anti-clean girl aesthetic, embodying influences from Helena Bonham Carter, Absolutely Fabulous, and the iconic Jane Birkin bag. This collection embraces imperfect, chaotic looks, such as uncombed hair after a one-night stand and mismatched socks.
