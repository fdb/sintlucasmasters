Challenging contemporary notions on how science is communicated, this project questions whether art can rank alongside more traditional scientific outputs. By transforming data into a tangible, interactive form, the project aims to turn passive observers into engaged discussants. 

Challenging contemporary notions on how science is communicated, 'Aesthetic Complexity' prompts an inquiry into the integration of art with traditional scientific outputs. Through the transformation of data into a tangible, interactive form, this project aims to turn passive observers into engaged discussants. Operating at the intersection of the tactile and digital realms, it carefully explores crafting data representations that are both accurate and visually compelling.
At the heart of this exploration lies a sculptural representation, the 'data vase,' which incorporates real data points. This sculpture invites viewers into an intriguing world where looking and reading intertwine, revealing hidden data narratives. As beholders interact with the data, they are encouraged to unearth connections and find personal resonance within the research.
Ultimately, 'Aesthetic Complexity' aspires to democratize knowledge by offering an accessible and engaging platform for encountering complexity. By merging artistry with data, it attempts to empower beholders to engage with scientific concepts in a meaningful way.
