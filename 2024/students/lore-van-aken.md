GIRLHOOD AS RESISTANCE

A new era: being soft in an ugly, emphatic, intricate, complex way.
A new being: the Guman, the comPOST-girl, who makes ‘kin not babies’.
The ground-human, a little girl, a person, kissing the rock they hold in the palm of their hand.
Their hair and tendrils are wrapped around their limbs as they become one with all that they love.
