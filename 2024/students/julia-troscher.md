Shifting between lines of individual genealogy and cosmic creation, this work reflects on the private and broader relations we foster with our surroundings. Separate, not so separate narratives are coming together to consider history, humanity, ecology; fish, phones, mothers, spaceships and the sea.

Shifting between lines of individual genealogy and cosmic creation, this work reflects on the private and broader relations we foster with our surroundings. Separate, not so separate narratives are coming together to consider history, humanity, ecology; fish, phones, mothers, spaceships and the sea.

In the film the figure of a fish human stands as a metaphor for the genealogy of the universe but also that of myself. We follow the journey of a ceramic fish as it travels from one hand to the next, from place to place, from one time to another. We encounter grandmothers, mothers and daughters, experiencing a poem about the past, present, and future of human and more-than-human inhabitants of the planet.
The bench was modelled after those set near the river in Mainz, where it was first exhibited as part of the exhibition Unextractable: Sammy Baloji invites, at the Kunsthalle Mainz. The starting point of this work was a poem I wrote in a workshop during my Premaster with Sammy Baloji.
