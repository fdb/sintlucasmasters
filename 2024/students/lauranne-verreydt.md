A collection of rituals, inspired by natural elements. Getting back to my intuitive nature and visualizing my own rituals. A tactile journey away from distractions. Slow down while finding your center not as a religion but as a practice. 

the rituals I perform and visualize act as anchor points of rest and contemplation. These rituals, captured in the clay and canvas, carry with them the energy of their creative process.

What can be the impact of rituals related to nature, on a contemporary art practice? 
 
A collection of rituals, inspired by natural elements. Getting back to my intuitive nature and visualizing my own rituals. A tactile journey away from distractions. The world we live in today is out of balance and we are experiencing a disconnection from nature. People are losing their inner center and this is causing serious physical and mental instability.

Slow down while finding your center not as a religion but as a practice. It reminds us that beneath the surface of our busy lives there is a shared humanity waiting to connect with each other.

The rituals I perform and visualize act as anchor points of rest and contemplation. These rituals, captured in the clay and canvas, carry with them the energy of their creative process.

In my ceramics I visualize my rituals, leaving behind an expression of these rituals. My canvases are about the process and remnant of this ritual. I want the energy of these rituals to shine through my work and for the viewer to experience or take home a form of meditation or mental cleansing. By visualizing my rituals and capturing them in my ceramics and paintings, I create a physical manifestation of inner peace and contemplation. The viewer is invited not only to look, but also to feel and experience. My hope for the viewer is that my work will help them find a moment of serenity and introspection, hopefully allowing them to bring some of that peace into their own lives. 

It was a very personal process that brought me to this end result. I started working around rituals because this is an important part of my life to find peace from physical and emotional pains, as a process of processing I use meditation focused rituals. Then by looking for what the basis of my existence is, I ended up with older, pre-historical societies. I have come to the realization that we are not too different from those who came before us. I have encountered myself in exploring this and had to question myself in order to arrive at the visual works that will be my end result.
