We have shifted into a world of extravagance, tastelessness, aesthetic fetishism, nauseating luxury, rigid similarity, mediatised fads; reality has gone digital has become idealized. My history and love superficial. Empirical truths are denied by my president and my mother. I am but coded, bits and pieces commodified. -you, -me, -everybody on the internet.
