Plagued with ambitions, four different abominations let their haunting presence known. Tormented by their own existence, they can't help but spread their feelings of dread. Confront them in virtual reality and face your fears.

In this virtual reality project, vile and twisted creatures exist. These beings torment everyone who faces them with excessive feelings of dread; the weight of ambition, illusion of grandeur, or a feeling of inferiority amongst peers. With the use of AI, these abominations were born through an extensive technical process. Their skin constantly shifts and changes into a weird blend of flesh and blood, scaring everyone who dares to approach them. Being fascinated by the AIâ€™s limits, I looked for ways to exploit its imperfections and purposely set out to create amalgamations of creativity. With the use of motion capture I was able to fully immerse myself in becoming my own worst fears. Even the voices that come forth from these beings are self created. This entire world can be experienced in virtual reality. A tool that allows for a greater exploration and immersion of this 3D world, transporting the user into this realm of dismay.
