«Birds are singing of salvation» is an essay film that reflects on Nastia's layered relationship with her motherland, Russia. Nastia’s displacement from the nest of her country overlaps with the forced separation of her family across different spaces. Dreaming of coming altogether for a family dinner, she constructs a narrative about the irreversibility of life from a bird’s-eye view, flying against the missiles in the sky:

Chik-chirik, chik-chirik. Mama, give me food. No food, no answer. Chik-chirik.
