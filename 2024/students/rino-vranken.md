Inserting the avatar into tangible space, this project is a love letter to my digital body. The skin that transcends offline reality.

I love my computer and I hate going outside. Every day I try my best to maximize my screentime as much as I am physically capable of. Both online and offline, I am my avatar. An infinity pool of identities. 
This project is a love letter to the skins I’ve worn and the ones I’m wearing now.
