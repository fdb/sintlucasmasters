A graphic novel about motherhood, about being human, yet holding a wolf within.

“My Mother is a Human” is a graphic novel about the ambiguous experience of motherhood. The story depicted in the novel is about a woman encountering different complicated and contradictory emotions towards her child. She loves her child dearly, cares about him, and wants to give all she can while being a mother, but at the same time, there are moments when she feels tired, anxious, irritated, angry, and guilty for experiencing these unwanted feelings. Anger is revealed in this story in the most obvious way because, at a certain point, the mother turns into a wolf. 
There are no words in the novel; the narrative is conveyed solely through pictures that are very metaphorical, which create a lot of space for various interpretations. 
The image of the mother presented in social media and art tends to be idealized. Mothers are judged for how they choose to raise their children, their emotions and reactions, and their failure to live up to the ideal that society promotes. In this story, I wanted to show a depiction of a mother that is not idealized. A portrayal of a mother who can get frustrated or angry because not all aspects of parenting are always fulfilling and rewarding. 
While I don't want to encourage mothers' rage, I do want to acknowledge its normality. I would like the audience to feel supported by realizing that they are not alone in their similar experiences.
