A series of paintings Presenting, A visual odyssey through a surrealistic landscape, born from introspection, as a thoughtscape of unconventional narrative design.

Throughout the year, my autonomous work has been a journey of introspection and creative exploration. Initially, my focus was on processing the thoughts and emotions that occupied significant space in my mind, inevitably seeping into my artwork. This led me to develop my own visual language, heavily influenced by surrealism, symbolism, and romanticism, with a strong foundation in classical art history and a deep love for folkloric, fairy tale, and mythological themes.

My paintings explore a range of themes, including loneliness, femininity, adolescence, mental instability, and anxiety. Each of these elements plays a subtle yet important role in my art. There is a clear homage to the arts I grew up with, which have significantly influenced my visual language and aesthetic choices.

While the humanoid figures in my work are not literal self-portraits, they represent expansions of my ideas and struggles. Through them, I hope others can find moments of self-reflection or relate to the emotions and themes depicted. My work is a blend of personal expression and universal exploration, aiming to connect with viewers on a deeper level.
