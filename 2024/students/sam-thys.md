I am researching how to change behavior by using natural materials, specifically algae, in visual art. My work integrates algae to challenge conventional perceptions and promote ecological consciousness. By showcasing algae's versatility and beauty, I aim to inspire sustainable practices and a deeper connection with nature. This fusion of art and environment highlights the potential of natural materials in driving behavioral change.

n my current research, I am exploring the transformative potential of natural materials, specifically algae, in influencing human behavior. By integrating algae into my visual art practice, I aim to challenge and expand the conventional perceptions of art materials and their impact on sustainability and ecological consciousness. Through this approach, my work not only highlights the aesthetic and functional versatility of algae but also serves as a medium for promoting environmentally responsible behavior.
