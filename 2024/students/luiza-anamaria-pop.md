This project explores retrieving lost art through a philosophical lens, challenging human-centric perspectives by uncovering the value of discarded objects. Using hybridization and kitbashing, I create 3D models of waste for new digital products. My project explores how repurposing discarded objects into digital forms enhances creativity and innovation, blending technology with artistic expression.


My masterâ€™s thesis explores retrieving lost art through a philosophical lens, challenging human-centric perspectives by investigating the inherent value of objects. I focus on hybridization and kitbashing to examine how discarded objects contain untapped metadata. By scanning waste and creating 3D models, I repurpose these objects into new digital products, finding uses in the digital realm. This project highlights the value in seemingly useless items, revealing societal reflections through discarded remnants. Ultimately, my research connects existentialist theories with artistic expression.
