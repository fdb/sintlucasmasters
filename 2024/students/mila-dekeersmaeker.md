This project explores the integration of green spaces within the urban context of the city Antwerp. It provides information on the issue and the current situation, creative solutions, and inspiring examples that can encourage residents and policymakers to make a positive change.

In times of climate crisis, the importance of biodiversity becomes more and more evident.
Urban landscapes often seem too densely built for nature to co-exist, despite cities playing a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. There are plenty of sustainable and innovative methods to integrate nature into the cityscape.
“Rooting for Regrowth” delves into this topic and the current urban situation. Instead of just highlighting the problem, this project also provides creative solutions and inspiring examples to encourage residents and policymakers to contribute to a greener, more sustainable city.
