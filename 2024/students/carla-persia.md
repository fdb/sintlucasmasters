A series on animal prints delves into fauna and flora designs through textile experiments. These patterns find broad applications in fashion, decor, and art. Dynamic motifs capture nature's essence with creative adaptability. The exploration reveals versatile charm in nature-inspired prints.

A series on animal prints explores the interplay of fauna and flora through diverse textile experiments, highlighting their broad applicability across various contexts. The animal textile print installations are meticulously arranged to immerse viewers in the designs' beauty and convey the project's message. Each installation features large-scale textile panels that display the final illustrations, creating a cohesive narrative and enabling close engagement with intricate details and vibrant colors.

These installations elevate the prints beyond mere fabric designs, enhancing their visibility and credibility as pieces of art. Additionally, the application of the prints in fashion amplifies their impact and relevance. A printed blazer and t-shirt serve as wearable expressions of the designs, integrating them into everyday life and sparking conversations about the intersection of art, fashion, and conservation.

Accompanying the installations and fashion pieces is a process portfolio documenting the creative journey. It showcases experiments with fabrics, colors, and compositions, highlighting the versatility of the prints. The portfolio demonstrates their application in interior design, such as upholstery, curtains, or wall art, expanding their potential beyond art pieces.
