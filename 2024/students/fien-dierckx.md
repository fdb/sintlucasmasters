An exploration of how childhood audio shapes and resonates with me now. Combining computer analysis with personal connotations, this project delves into core memories and their impact, translating their emotional and psychological effects into visual form, bridging the past and present.


In my project, "Resonating Memories," I delve into how childhood sounds shape us as adults. Using a mix of art and computer analysis, I explore why these memories stick with us. By listening to old audio clips from my youth, I uncover patterns that stir up strong emotions. Then, I turn these findings into art, but it's also about what these memories mean to me personally. Memories are deeply personal, shaped by our experiences and feelings. I want to capture that sense of nostalgia and connection. The art I create acts like a time machine, making people think about their own childhood sounds and how they still affect them today. With this project, I delve into how these memories shape us while celebrating the power of nostalgia.
