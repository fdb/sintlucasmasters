Through the realities of displacement and open-mindedness, this work explore how artists harness their imagination to conceive alternative and innovative ways of perceiving and interpreting all situations. As displaced peoople navigating challenges, creative faculties may delve into uncanny realms, conjuring negative mental landscapes due to the adversities unique to their status.
