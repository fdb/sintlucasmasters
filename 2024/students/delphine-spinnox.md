This work centres around a ceramic sculpture representing my safe self, contrasted with a poem-video that depicts a situation where this sense of safety is disturbed by catcalling.  What may seem like a potato at first is me. I am a ceramic-potato, a ceramic-woman, I am a potato-woman.

The year began with reflecting on my childhood drawings from when I was 2 to 3 years old. These almost unrecognisable characters intrigued me, inspiring me to translate them into my practice with clay and ceramics. My struggles during the year have led me to understand the core of my practice: the serene feeling I experience while working with clay and ceramics. Embracing this feeling, I created a technically advanced ceramic sculpture, more intricate than anything I had attempted before. This exploration helped me project a sense of safety in my ceramics, contrasting starkly with a distressing event on the streetâ€”an instance of catcalling that disrupted my sense of safety and serenity.

My work centres around a ceramic sculpture representing my safe self, contrasted with a poem-video that depicts a situation where this sense of safety is disturbed by catcalling. This sculpture embodies the culmination of my experiences and growth as an artist. It is crafted with clay slabs, reinforcing the connection between the material and the safe feeling that also originates from my childhood drawings. 

Despite the challenges and intense self-reflection, I feel more connected to my work than ever. Through my ceramics, I put a piece of myself on display. The sculpture's form, resembling a potato, ties back to the simplicity of my childhood drawings. Given the personal nature of this project and my mother tongue being French, it felt only right to title it in French.
