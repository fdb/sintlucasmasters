Stay a Little Longer explores how shadows and light mix in the late hours, going beyond just capturing insomnia. It shows how a personal project turned into a search for the gentle, fleeting quality of light—an intimate journey born from quiet nights without sleep.

The origin of this work can be traced back to sleeplessness which resulted in long restless hours during the night. The project evolved into a study of light during darkness and a search for a way to capture the fragility of these unique moments between light and dark.
