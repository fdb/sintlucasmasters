Through my bachelor thesis, I discovered my passion for pattern design and wanted to continue developing this in my master's year. I wanted to adapt my theme around patterns and spent a long time searching for a suitable theme that I felt passionate about. During this process, a fashion student contacted me to design prints for her collection, and I quickly saw this as a collaboration that was relevant to my master's thesis. This led us to the subject of local flowers, and I immersed myself in floral motifs in the fashion world. I conducted extensive research into the history of floral motifs and their use in the fashion world, and this is how I started making my own drawings of local wildflowers.

For the collaboration, I designed several prints that we had printed, and I continued drawing flowers and then screen-printed these drawings myself onto textiles. I enlarged the flowers significantly so that the beautiful forms of the flowers could be shown to better effect. I experimented extensively with screen printing, which produced some very interesting compositions.

You see wildflowers less and less. With Blooming Era, I want to make people aware of their beauty!
