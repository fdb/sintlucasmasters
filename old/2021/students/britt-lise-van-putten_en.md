When we look at our history, we see a highly anti-woman framework for understanding the world. Because of this, gender inequality is deeply embedded in our subconscious. The witch hunt is seen by many feminists as a war against women. A violent war that has left its mark on the present. Without realizing it, we still live with remnants of the worldview of that time.

'The Witch Hunt' is a frame by frame animation about these destructive remnants. Remnants that still negatively affect the lives of women today. In the animation, the witch hunt and the elements embedded in our culture through this event are questioned. Only through constant questioning of history does awareness slowly but surely emerge. Awareness that our "self-evident" worldview perpetuates gender inequalities.
