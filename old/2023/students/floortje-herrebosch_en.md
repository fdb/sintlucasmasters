A project about the package insert of the contraceptive pill to highlight the importance of reading it. A process full of research and experimentation with communication, typography and design.

A project based on the package insert of the contraceptive pill. An investigation that started with texts that are not read and ended with a fictional campaign from the pharmaceutical company 'Organon'. An ideal opportunity to design a series of posters to highlight the importance of reading the package insert. By experimenting with communication, typography and design. The posters contain three quotes: 'Blood clots from the pill?', 'Taking the pill for the first time?' and 'I forgot to take the pill?'. The aim is to address users who experience these problems, or want to know more about them. The answer to these questions is therefore a reference to the package insert, which tells you everything about it.
