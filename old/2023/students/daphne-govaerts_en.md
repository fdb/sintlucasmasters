In this graphic novel, I share through a personal perspective the raw emotions following the tragic loss of a dear friend to suicide. With poetic imagery, heartfelt texts and raw emotions, the pages unfold to depict the complexity of grief, unwavering inner resilience and profound healing.

In The Beast I Call Grief, my graphic novel, an exploration of the grieving process unfolds, as I delve into the intricate emotions that arise when confronted with the tragic loss of a loved one to suicide.
For me, it was a personal journey of memories, grief and acceptance after losing a good friend.

With ink as my medium, I bring a visual story to life. The visual narrative is accompanied by heartfelt text that reinforces the emotional resonance.
These words I wish to share with those who have experienced the fear and confusion of such a tremendous loss.

By creating The Beast I Call Grief, I aim to shed light on the multifaceted nature of grief following the loss of someone to suicide. I want to capture its complexity and offer comfort to those who have endured such great loss. Through illustrating a personal experience.

It is a visual and emotional journey that aims to provide understanding, empathy and comfort to those who have experienced loss, while also raising awareness about the complexity of grief and the importance of support in the field of mental health.

I hope that by sharing this intimate and profound journey, I can contribute to a broader conversation about mental health, healing and the importance of compassion for those who have experienced the devastating impact of suicide.
