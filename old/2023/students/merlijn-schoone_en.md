The first steps towards an artistic magazine about cosplay. Aimed at those who know little to nothing about cosplay but want to learn more about it and would like to get a clear view of what cosplay has to offer. For each issue, the magazine highlights a different cosplayer who comes to bring their story.

I am currently working on an artistic magazine about cosplay, specially aimed at people who know little or nothing about cosplay, but would like to learn more and get a clearer picture of what cosplay has to offer. Cosplay is a form of performance art in which artists portray characters, ideas or objects from comics, anime, books, films, series and games using costumes.

Each issue of the magazine features a different cosplayer, where they share their story. There are many different categories and aspects within the cosplay world where each cosplayer finds their occupation. Some spend a lot of time creating detailed costumes, others focus more on photography and organize photoshoots with and for cosplayers. There are also groups that focus on the 'performance' aspect and practice together for performances at conventions.

My goal is to provide educational content, inspire readers and promote understanding and appreciation for cosplay.

The combination of my passion for editorial design and my own cosplay hobby has led me to this field of research, which I will explore further during my master's year. My hope is to eventually create a full-fledged magazine that helps beginning cosplayers to orient themselves in the world of cosplay. Furthermore, it would give me great satisfaction if I could engage people with the cosplay community and bring a better image of cosplay to the outside world.
