We all have dreams the only difference is that not everyone has the opportunity to pursue them


Myrthe travelled to Greece to follow a dream.
To be able to travel anywhere without issue is something she never saw as a privilege. Until she worked at a community center for refugees for three months. There she took the time to listen to their stories and experiences and asked what they dreamed of. 
 
When she became aware of the fact that not everyone gets the same chances in life, she made it her mission to picture this to broth audience to make them aware that they are on the other side, the side of the privileges. 
 
We all have dreams the only difference is that not everyone has the opportunity to pursue them.
