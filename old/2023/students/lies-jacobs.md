September 25, 2022, at dusk, my elderly mother passed away.  
The molecules in the room behaved strangely. Dying happened as suddenly as new life gasping for breath. In which direction do these forces go? Everything happens, everything moves on, and we don't know where we are going, only this: Nature never goes back; it always moves on.

An ear, the living moss, hou-vast's cast in plaster, a carefully dug well in the garden, primal elements of nature in one work. It seems an unlikely combination, but they share a common thread: the power to connect us to the world in meaningful ways. By exploring the symbolic meaning of the ear and the transformative power of the moss, in this work I create a space where we connect to the world around us on a deeper level. It allows us to explore the notion of loss and grief, create spaces of healing and connection, and promote understanding between ourselves and others. Does caring for someone or something equate to keeping something alive. They remind us of the interconnectedness of all things and the power we have to shape our own experiences and the world around us.
