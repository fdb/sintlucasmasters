I have chosen to dip a toe into the deep waters of the graphic design field. And in doing so, lift a corner of the veil and see how it all fits together and how a beginning graphic designer can/must navigate in today's world. This way I wanted to gain experience with clients and their briefs and feedback. And to also think about the way design is approached these days and what the position of a (beginning) designer is and the advantages and disadvantages that come with it. So each project was in itself an investigation into image, typography and design.

I have chosen to dip a toe into the deep dark waters of the graphic design field. And in doing so, lift a corner of the veil and see how it all fits together and how a beginning graphic designer can/must navigate in today's world. This way I wanted to gain experience with clients and their briefs and feedback. So I got the chance to process a variety of briefs and feedback (some clearer than others).
And to also think about the way design is approached these days and what the position of a (beginning) designer is and the advantages and disadvantages that come with it.

Each project is in itself also an investigation into image, experiment, typography, colour etc.

My work consists of a variety of graphic materials, both end products and process materials. In order to give an impression of my master's thesis. Made with Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator etc.
