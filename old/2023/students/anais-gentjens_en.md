Choreographic Co-Creation is a dance tool that takes on different visual forms based on a video. A dancer or choreographer can use this to gain new insights through their own material and be inspired by their own movement language. The dancer improvises based on the results created through the dance tool.

For my master's project, I investigated ways in which dance phrases can be visualized digitally. Is there still a need for a physical, moving body in our digital age in the context of dance practices, or can projections serve just as well as a complete dance performance? In what ways can the body be depicted in an unconventional manner? How abstract can a body be represented to still spark interest with the viewer?

My research evolved into abstracting and translating embodied movements into different visual forms, such as dancing circles, colors, and dynamic line play. This resulted in various projections of my motion data. Building on this, I was able to transform dance movements into perceptible sound waves. In doing so, I develop a process in which I work in co-authorship with my computer to creatively engage in creating contemporary dance choreographies. As a dancer and choreographer, I want to examine whether kinetic movement forms can contribute to the artistic processes in my interdisciplinary practice.
