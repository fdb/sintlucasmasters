Digital communication plays an increasingly prominent role in our current society. The material nature of a handwritten letter evokes different feelings, regardless of content, than a letter composed using modern text processors (such as Word, Pages or the typewriter). How is it that we have completely shifted our focus to digital text processors in such a short period within our history? Is there still hope for manual communication tools or is the letter destined to disappear in this digital age? In 'love for letters', the written word takes centre stage. The book contains a series of love letters written throughout history. Each chapter comprises a letter that is analyzed in depth, with context taking centre stage alongside materiality. The book seeks to create a reappreciation for manual communication.
