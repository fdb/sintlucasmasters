DEFQON.1, a raw music festival finding its way back in graphic posters. A project consisting of video, music and graphic design inseparably connected with each other.
In this master project, a combination of graphic works is shown with audiovisual images. All of this naturally takes place with music from the harder styles as a starting point. This creates music-generated graphic works. Already curious about how this music style goes together with graphic design? Then definitely come to the master expo from June 21 to 28, 2023!
