With the rise of machines, the craft of making books by hand is disappearing. Machines will take over the tasks and bookbinding will become a lost craft.

Because of this problem, I decided to put the craft and binding methods (by hand) back in the spotlight.

A book is an object that people have grown up with and come into contact with almost daily.
Because 'a book' exists in many diverse forms and ways, it ensures a personal touch.

In the graphic world, the book is viewed from a different perspective and is also a separate discipline. Within book design, the choice of binding technique plays an important role. The right choice of binding technique adds value to the product.

In the era we now live in, almost everything is digital. Handwork and the craft of bookbinding are disappearing. Designers design their layouts digitally, send their files via email, have them made by machines and receive their end product by post.

This lost handwork and craft caught my attention. BINDING ensures that the craft and binding methods (by hand) are put back in the spotlight.
