In my artistic practice, I seek out the boundary between sustainable and disposable materials. In doing so, the value of mass production and the idea of authenticity play an important role. In my ceramic work, I also pose questions about the functionality of everyday objects and the throwaway culture that comes with it. I investigate what form, quality, and material this knowledge can take.

What do we take with us from our ancestors and what do we want to leave behind for the next generations?
