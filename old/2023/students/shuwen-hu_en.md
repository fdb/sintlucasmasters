We are constantly being surveilled and we need to be aware of this. Otherwise we will soon get to a point where we are entering a real life episode of a Black Mirror-surveilled world. With my masterproject, I want to trigger the feeling of being watched, the feeling of being surveilled. My goal is to create awareness of the surveillance around us. 

I did a lot of research about surveillance and its concerning side and I found a website where you can get access to unsecured or poorly secured surveillance camera’s. You could click on any country and there would be a lot of live streams you could watch. With the livestream, you also get a lot of extra information, such as the coordinates of the location, the timezone and the manufacturer of the camera. It got very scary when I was looking at a woman in a kitchen making a sandwich, without her even knowing that she was being watched. With my installation of video footages and camera’s, I want to make people aware of the dystopian side of surveillance. Looking at my installation is participating in watching people, as well as being watched. The video footages are snippets of video’s that I collected throughout my research.
