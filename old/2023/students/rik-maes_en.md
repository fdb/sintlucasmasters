The year is 2101, humanity has left Earth and developed a new space colony around the Moon. A vision of the future inspired by NASA's 'Gateway', which has since become reality. In this short film, we follow the daily routine of a lonely worker who tries to bring nature with him.

Starting from my fascination with space travel, I soon positioned myself within science fiction. What particularly interested me in the stories within this genre is the credibility it can bring. This is achieved by placing the unknown in a recognizable context that is related to humanity. This gives us a feeling that it could become reality in a few years. This prompted me to look at current space programs, particularly NASA's Artemis program, in which they are developing a new space station around the Moon, called the 'Gateway'.

For my project, I use this 'Gateway' as the basis for my own vision of the future. Humanity has completely left Earth and this space station will serve as a central hub around which a new space colony has developed. In my short film, I explore various tensions and themes that emerge in it, for example the tendency to bring nature into an artificial environment. I focus on human actions and daily routine to give a new definition to science fiction.
