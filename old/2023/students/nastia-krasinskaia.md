Having moved to Belgium in 2021, Nastia Krasinskaia has been trying to take a step back and understand where she comes from: her background, her country, her home. Home. The space of the kitchen, the space of the living room, the space of the memories – home. The one that kills other hom(m)es.

Having moved from Russia to Belgium in 2021, Nastia Krasinskaia has been trying to take a step back and understand where she comes from: her background, her country, her home. Home. The space of the kitchen, the space of the living room, the space of the memories – home. The one that kills other hom(m)es.
The video installation "Toys we played with as kids" has been done by Nastia being abroad from her country for almost two years. The work is bringing us back to the memory landscapes of her childhood inevitably framed with the context of the war. The project reflects on the state when naive and delightful moments from the past start to overlap with the phantom of death. The core image of the installation becomes the Matryoshka. It (she) takes different angles and transforms from a simple wooden toy and the symbol of the state to Nastia's 'prababushka' (great-grandmother) and the image of expected life. Baby, that cannot be delivered. Baby, that is being buried.
