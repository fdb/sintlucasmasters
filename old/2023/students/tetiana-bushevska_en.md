This project is about the specific sounds of a (my) house and their meaning for a feeling of safety and peace. The impulse for this research was my experience with migration, because during the first half year I still dreamed about the sounds of my previous house. In the publication I collect subtle monoprints about my house, feelings and sounds. And in the stop-frame animation I bring to life the sounds that represent a feeling of "being at home" for me.

This is a project about the sounds of my house. Every house sounds different. The inspiration for this project is my immigration experience. During the first half year of my life in Belgium, I dreamed of the sounds of my previous house in Ukraine. I literally heard the sound of the door lock, the jingling of my old keys, etc. Today I have forgotten it. Now my world, my new house is filled with other sounds. I had to get used to the sounds of my new house for a while. But these are also temporary. That is why I wanted to collect these sounds and fix them in a certain way. I did it in the form of stop-motion animation, in which I recorded the original sounds (from sounds that electrical appliances produce to the birdsong of my canaries...) and I illustrated them with oil-on-glass animation. In addition, I also made a publication with monotypes about my house, feelings and sounds. Sounds are an inseparable part of our house. They form an invisible atmosphere. In our house all sounds are familiar and comfortable - no sound disturbs us, we know them all. This creates a feeling of safety and comfort. This is also my message to everyone who owns a house or needs a house - to think about the importance of simple everyday things, about what surrounds us at home... And how does your house sound?
