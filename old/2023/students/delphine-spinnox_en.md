The artwork offers viewers a glimpse into a world beyond their comprehension but full of endless possibilities, inspired by the deep sea and its mysterious creatures. Bringing you into my imaginary world.

My artwork reflects an imaginary and mysterious world, filled with chaos and wonder. Inspired by the deep sea and its creatures, I found solace in ceramics as I struggled to translate my imagination digitally. Discovering the puzzling process of sculpting clay, I felt inspired to create my own mysterious creatures, fueled by my fascination with imagined beings on our planet.

The unpredictability of clay sculptures fascinated me—the unknown end results, the departure from a world obsessed with perfection and predictability. In a realm dominated by AI, where imagination is replaced by polished outputs, relinquishing control, and embracing imperfection became liberating. Clay sculptures were a gateway to uncertainty, where shapes transformed in the kiln and glazes held delightful surprises. This process became an exciting exploration, allowing the monsters I created to take on their own life, subtly mutating along the way.

My artwork invites viewers to immerse themselves in a world that defies comprehension but brims with infinite possibilities. It is a tribute to the mysterious depths of the ocean and the captivating creatures that dwell within it.
