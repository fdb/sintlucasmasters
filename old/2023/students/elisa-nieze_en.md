Flowers have been inspiring for centuries with their beauty and symbolism in art, fashion and religion. Unfortunately, they are threatened by deforestation, climate change and pesticides, which affects their survival. With my prints on textiles, I want to raise awareness for 'forgotten' flowers and contribute to the protection of endangered flowers.

Finding inspiration in the beauty of flowers is something that has been happening for years. Their aesthetic appeal and symbolic meaning have always fascinated people. Flowers have had influence in various ways, for example in Vanitas painting as a symbol of mortality, in the fashion industry where we have seen floral prints for years and even in the medical world. Elisa wanted to investigate the impact that we as humans have on flowers. Unfortunately, the negative effects of human activities have had a considerable impact on flowers. Various activities such as deforestation, climate change, street lighting and pesticides have a negative influence on the color, scent and contribute to the extinction and endangerment of flowers.

Elisa's goal is to put 'forgotten' flowers back in the spotlight with the help of artistic prints that she applies to textiles. She has experimented with different techniques such as screen printing, embroidery, painting, cyanotype printing, and more. Elisa wants to apply these prints to clothing to contribute to awareness of the fragility of nature. She hopes that her work can motivate people and make a positive contribution to the protection of endangered flora.
