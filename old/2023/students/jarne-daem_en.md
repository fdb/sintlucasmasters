In the tavern 't Konijnenhol, all sorts of people come through the door every day, ranging from knights to artists, from merchants to pilgrims.

In Taberna, you are taken to a tavern in 15th-century Bruges. The focus is on the stories of the ordinary person, people from all walks of life, not just the nobility and kings as is so often the case.
