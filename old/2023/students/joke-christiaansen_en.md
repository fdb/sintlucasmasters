Omdat de weg er naar toe belangrijker is dan een afgewerkt product.

Objects we use in everyday life. Do we look at them? Really look at them? Do they have value for us? These objects/trash, we handel them everyday. We buy it, use it for what we should use it and then trow it out again. it is part of our fast culture. A culture where we don't take time to stand still and really look at something or ourselves. and you are you now taking your time to read this? And why are these objects trash? Why not repurpose them, or repair our broken things instead of buying somthing new?
