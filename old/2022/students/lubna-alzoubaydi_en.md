I looked at the problems that women experience in Iraq and took that as a starting point for my work. In October 2021 I traveled to Iraq, Babylon to film women and see what they experience on a daily basis and what problems they encounter. After this entire process I began with my sketches on that subject. From the sketches I extracted the forms for my visual art and paintings. I want to show how you can create an image of a woman, not in a traditional way but in a different way. For that I used various materials such as fabric, plaster, metal, clay and acrylic. For my work I was inspired by the war, the history of Iraq.
