Lies Jacobs (born 1964) directs her gaze towards things, stories, memories, and people that often go unnoticed. In 'Tu Dois Faire Des Choses,' she questions why we as a society have become estranged from care-taking. In her most recent work, she poses questions about this: Who should do things? Why, and who says you should do things? Whose things are they? Who should pick them up and care for them? Who cares for whom?

By caring for and aestheticizing found objects, she experiments intuitively with materials. Certain objects are carefully packed and unpacked. Each object is unique. Through her radical perspective of care-taking, she pays attention to the distinctiveness of each thing and seeks a place for it within the whole. In spaces that are often forgotten, she creates carrying places. Where she makes new constellations with the objects.

It is an ode to care-taking through which things matter again.

Her workshops are encounters, and the objects become windows into our soul.
