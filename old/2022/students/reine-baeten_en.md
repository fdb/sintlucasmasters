Last year I created my own mythological beings out of dissatisfaction with the existing range of religions and mythological pantheons. In this master year I brought 4 of these gods to life by transforming them into wearable costumes. In their mythology, it is about the deities being estranged from the city and its culture. Even their presence stands in contrast with their surroundings. In the forest, nature, they feel completely at home, but they are far removed from their social network. There is a tension, an attraction that draws them to the city - away from the familiar - to a place where they fundamentally seem not to fit the picture. The photographic images were created in collaboration with Yannick Mastbooms.
