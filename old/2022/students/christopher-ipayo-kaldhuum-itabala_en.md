Tool where not only successful/black role models can be found but also motivation and inspiration can be gained to study what we really want to study.

**Blext** is an app where black students have the opportunity to find black role models. For this, they get a better and comprehensive picture of not only their studies but also the various opportunities they have after their studies. The app also features a podcast where you constantly get the latest news from upcoming role models and projects, and a platform where role models share their inspirations and motivations in detail with the next generation.
