There is this thing we call the unknown.
It goes beyond existence
Endless & complete
living an eternity.
And in a brief moment, it might form a body 
Passing through life
Only to explore and wander
To once again become 
An imperishable vibration.


Chronicle 0: There is no time except now. History and future come together in a moment. And create a story. A story of facts and legends, a myth.

This is not about reality or actuality. It is about the space between the real and the unreal.
Chronicles are about ordered history. The zero (0), however, does not indicate a year. It points to the in-between space where everything and nothing is possible and merges into each other like a collision, a clash. "Colliding spheres". That word, in-between space, is very important to grasp the whole. Simply put, you can view it as division by zero. Whoever divides by zero gets an error. That error is the field I am speaking about. It is the place that exists (or does not exist) of contradictions. Where time is brought together, where the impossible is possible, where being or not being are not questioned because it is solely about existence. Thus it is about a paradox.

The first five months the focus was mainly on the narrative. I let myself be inspired by everything that was not Western: Philosophies, lifestyles, stories and objects. Mainly from East Asian cultures and occasionally something else. All the information I gathered I blended with my own artistic fantasies and ideas. The individual works and stories can be found on the website: https://www.yasmine-akondo.be/works/2022

In the second part of the year I decided to include another aspect in my work: that of action. I wanted my work to not just become a sculpture with a story but to effectively gain a function. And thus, it can be activated. I designed a triptych step by step. (With the performance clothes included it becomes a tetralogy). Each sculpture has its own name, function and background. They are not necessarily coordinated with each other but can exist with and alongside each other. The theme I used to create the story was Purification. In a ritualistic way the character turns back into itself and lets go of the world around it in order to free itself of the unnecessary. This project builds on my bachelor graduation project: Eden. The idea is based on the zen ideology of Buddhism. Central to it is letting go.
1 The container: That which one always carries with you. Close to the body. What this is, is different for everyone. It is often something personal. It does not have to be an object but it can be. Often it is difficult to let go of.
2 Bodo Toto: Moving on. Letting go. That which you want to get rid of but still hold onto finally giving it a place and moving forward. Daring to give something else control of it.
3 Sound: Vibration through space and body. Purification of both. Activation of the water in the body through the vocal cords. A form of meditation in combination with zen. Closing off the letting go and taking the time for it.
The entire ritual is performed in a "safe" space, arranged as something sacred.
