Enclosure departs from observations made from a living room during the lockdown. The light that sneaks through the window. A passing car during the night. An endless sea, seen from a confined room. Seeking freedom in a closed space is what Enclosure shows through a digital short film.

On one hand, I try to bring people together with Enclosure. I want people to talk about how they experienced a moment of isolation. How they dealt with this isolation and how they look back on it. On the other hand, Enclosure is an introspection for me. A personal search for my experience of isolation but also further the room as a representation of myself. The way I project my feelings onto the furniture in the living room. I focus on subtle observations that are unique to that specific moment during the lockdown. I alternate between real observations and daydreams, playing with the viewer's expectations.

I try to lure the viewer in with the sound and light that falls through the window. I want the viewer to wonder what is happening behind this window. On the other hand, the focus point can be the room itself. If the television is playing, for example, an endless sea can be seen. The idea of freedom is suggested and called into question.
