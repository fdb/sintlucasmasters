With 'See the forest for the trees, I'll promise you'll make it' I take the stereotypical image of autism spectrum disorder with a grain of salt. Through moving image in an intimate setting, I conduct a parallel investigation into one of the most groundbreaking films in history. I myself see this artistic practice as the beginning of my acceptance process.
