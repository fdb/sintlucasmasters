The exponential increase in the acquisition of technological devices to assist our daily activities is consensual in our contemporary times. The distinction between technology and biology has been vanishing, and more and more, we are surrounded by artifacts with the ability to read our emotions —even if we are just considering a vacuum cleaner or a bread machine. The intimacy definition —related exclusively to the body— has been deviated with the introduction of the intimate technology term. With the help of intelligent design, machines acquired material attributes that allowed them to occupy additional spaces in our private sphere —beds, bathrooms— and even inside our bodies —body-hacking, sex toys, and health interventions. Hence, beyond modifying our relationship with the environment, machines have been as well altering human interactions.
