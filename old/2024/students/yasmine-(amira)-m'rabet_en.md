My project embraces a continuous metamorphosis, where emotions function as building blocks for a transformative journey. They awaken in the central limbic system of the brain, and express themselves in a beautiful dance of movement. In this evolution, catharsis is the ultimate destination, where emotions liberate themselves through the power of movement, a journey that forms the core of my installation.

The metal structure supports the sculptures that are rhythmically placed. Two types of clay represent absence and presence. The film is projected above for a clear emotional experience. Emotion is central, expressed through movement, and catharsis liberates through movement.
