The bicycle infrastructure in Antwerp, despite government efforts, remains inadequate, uncomfortable and sometimes even dangerous in many places. This installation, the BTS_200X, highlights this problem in a humorous way and hopes to spark discussion about bicycle mobility.

The coffee machine should make the long wait for cyclists at red lights more bearable. The five wheels, placed in a pentagon-shaped 'roll cage', helps you go over your head, for example at a cycle bridge that ends in stairs. Moped suspensions are installed to provide extra shock absorption. Airbags provide protection for when you hit tram tracks, for example. There is also a long extendable stick to help reach begging buttons that are in inconvenient places.

Most of the materials used are recycled pieces. The bicycle, which forms the basis of this installation, comes from a junkyard, as do the extra wheels. The coffee maker, springs and fishing pole are also recycled materials that were collected. The installation is entirely handmade, with most of the construction being welded.

With this Playful and provocative approach, the BTS_200X aims to raise awareness of the flaws in the current cycling infrastructure and encourage policymakers to take action.
