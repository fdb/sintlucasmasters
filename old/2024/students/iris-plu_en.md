Shadows of Critique: The Burden of Public Objectification examines the objectification of women in public spaces. Through monumental plaster sculptures and modern technologies, it aims to stimulate awareness and discussion for a more equitable society.

Shadows of Critique: The Burden of Public Objectification explores how women are objectified in public spaces. This is done through monumental plaster sculptures combined with modern technologies such as iPads and robotics. This mix of traditional materials and modern media not only breaks the static character of plaster, but also creates a dialogue between present and past. Through the use of plaster, the work anchors itself in the sculptural tradition, while the integration of contemporary technology refers to modern society.

The careful finishing of the sculptures reflects a dedication to craftsmanship and serves as a visual metaphor for refinement and finesse. The bright red nails, a symbol of femininity and strength, add a recognizable element to the works. Personal experiences and the emotions they evoke form the core of the sculptures. Each work highlights different forms of objectification, aiming to initiate a dialogue about how women are treated and depicted in public spaces.

While rooted in female experiences, the work is not exclusively aimed at a female audience. By combining classical and modern elements, the work aims to stimulate awareness and discussion and contribute to a more equitable society.
