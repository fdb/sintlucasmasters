Since 2022, Jax Buytaert has been developing slide film autodidactically. In his performative practice, he explores nocturnal scenes, banal, anonymous, empty spaces that are moreover shrouded in vague twilight. Characterized by intense texture and subtle gradations of grey, they reveal the elusive beauty of forgotten corners and traces of human presence.

"Dwaallicht" uses slide film to discover the unknown, with images that raise questions to seduce the viewer with suggestive vagueness. These images are made to be disorienting and thought-provoking, using a universal visual language. The process begins with shooting a film roll and experimenting with different development techniques, such as cross-processing and overdevelopment. This year I have applied hybrid methods, finding commercial properties through broker websites such as immoweb.com, saving online interior images and subsequently digitally projecting them and re-photographing them with film.

This approach blurs the boundaries between reality and fiction. Where I attempt to evoke emotions in viewers and leave them with more questions than answers. To convey a sense of alienation. Many are intentionally blurred or hidden in shadow making them ambiguous and open to interpretation. While the subjects may look familiar, these photographs are not intended to document the real world. In the darkroom, where I often push the boundaries of development to change the appearance of the images, emphasizing the physical qualities of the film itself. I avoid staged scenes and instead rely on my unique perspective to make an impact. The power of a photograph must come from the photograph itself, the composition and the way it is taken, not necessarily what it shows. Discussing the content could diminish its artistic and conceptual value, turning it into a simple illustration. My method involves capturing everyday aspects of my surroundings and re-presenting them in ways that create new narratives in the viewer's mind. This challenges their perceptions and promotes deeper engagement with the image. In my work, I value experiment, chance and spontaneity. Developing film is a precise activity that is heavily dependent on the quality of the chemicals and careful control over various factors. My approach is fluid, based on how long I decide to photograph or develop, driven by an internal pool of experiences and influences.
