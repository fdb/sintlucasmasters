Many young adults struggle with growing up and all the questions that come with it. Simply put, there's only one solution: DEAL WITH IT. A card game full of funny, unexpected and relatable situations. It makes young adults think about how they can solve situations and discuss them in a lighthearted and comedic way.

This project originated from the idea that young adults often experience the transition to adulthood as frightening. Hence, DEAL WITH IT, a card game filled with funny, ironic, unexpected and relatable situations that challenge young adults to think about how they can solve and discuss specific situations. In this way, topics such as career, relationships, finances and housing are tackled in a lighthearted and comedic manner. This makes it easier to make these topics discussable. Each situation card refers to specific information on the website, so that young adults can not only laugh, but also have access to useful and relevant information.

Furthermore, the game is promoted through an extensive campaign that focuses on situations as they also appear in the game. This way, young adults come into contact with the game and the situations it covers not only through the game itself, but also at various locations in their surroundings. DEAL WITH IT is not only seen as a funny and interactive game, it also offers young adults the opportunity to discuss topics that are outside their comfort zone with friends. This makes the transition to adulthood considerably less frightening and can become extraordinarily cool.
