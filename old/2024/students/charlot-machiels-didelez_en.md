'an exhibition that should have taken place' is a project about the overlapping between architecture, interior, scenography and graphic design. A research into what is shown but also the manner in which something is shown.

How can I, as a graphic designer with an interest in spatial design, design an exhibition series about the relationships that female designers have with the material and spatial environments they create? And in doing so, focus on the complex and varied relationships that the designers had with this? This is the research question on which the project is based.

This concept results in an 'Identity Folder' in which fixed choices are documented for the design of exhibitions. Both for specific designers and general ideas that can be used for every exhibition. The subject of the exhibition series is female designers throughout time. In addition to this publication, there is also a visual presentation of a possible concept for the scenography.

To document the complex process in a clear manner, this project includes a 'Research Folder'. In this, the progress is displayed visually. This is in the form of a concept map to indicate the connections between ideas and sources.
