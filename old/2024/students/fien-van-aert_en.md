Cryoforms is an exploratory project within its own world based on melting permafrost landscapes, explored through the animals and objects it preserves.

Cryoforms emerged from a fascination with well-preserved animal hides that remained frozen in permafrost for thousands of years. Due to the rapid melting of permafrost as a result of climate change, these animals are increasingly surfacing. The project has evolved into an exploration within its own world based on these landscapes, explored through the animals and objects it preserves.

In Cryoforms, wonder and tragedy complement each other. Finding an ancient preserved animal is a remarkable occurrence. At the same time, we cannot ignore the disintegration of the landscape that enabled its preservation and the eventual resurfacing of this creature. Some finds remain exceptionally well preserved, while others are partially decomposed. Sometimes it is difficult to determine what a found object once was. The boundaries between animal, object, and landscape become blurred.

The project ultimately took the form of a series of charcoal drawings, presented in a composition on the wall. Part of the installation consists of strange objects that allude to a landscape… or is it something animal-like? These forms made from stone, bark, paper, and modeling wax served as inspiration for the charcoal drawings and vice versa. A projection of the blurred environment in which the project unfolds completes the exploration.
