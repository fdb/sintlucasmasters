One hundred and one self-portraits.

Making paintings based on my aesthetic values, using faces. These faces are the result of faulty selfies (lots of movement and poor lighting) in which distortion is visible in the face. In this way I connect the historical aspect of portrait painting with contemporary portraiture—the selfie.
