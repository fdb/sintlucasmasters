How can we improve Belgian architecture and make it more ecological using basic knowledge from African clay architecture and vice versa?

Contrasting different cultures to form a coherent whole is what I do best. It's deeply rooted in my identity. I have a mixed background and that almost always translates into my work in various ways.
Prototype 1 is a Rwandan hut based on the house of King Mutara III. Decorated with Flemish symbols in the form of traditional Rwandan patterns. Boom bricks form a Rwandan (clay) hut.
In the hut you can see footballers... Racism doesn't exist in the football world... Until you lose or make a big mistake. This interests me.
