Nice moments at the café

My work stems from personal anecdotes. These often arise from social moments with friends and family. It could be a funny remark that one of my friends makes after a few glasses of wine or a characteristic personality trait. Often these inspirations translate into a painting. Other media that I frequently use are ceramics and installation.
