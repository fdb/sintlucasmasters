This project explores the connection between body and object, with the in-between space acting as a keeper of memories, represented through color. Jenthe hangs drawings on the objects and uses body postures to reflect personal memories of these objects.

The cut-outs in the canvas add an extra dimension to the work, making the emptiness and physical space between the objects and the body visually tangible. This in-between space is used to represent the invisible, yet palpable, presence of memories. The colors make these spaces visible and a visual language emerges.

'Keepers of Memories' is an invitation to the viewer to reflect on their own memories and the objects that preserve these memories. The project encourages a journey by exploring the relationship between body, object and memory. Through color, form and illustration, a work emerges that is both visually appealing and can be relatable.
