'No Man's Land' is an experimental video game about wandering, constant change and dissonance. Emerged from material and soul research, characterized by analog animation, stop-motion and snippets of poetry.

This video game is an exploration into digital self-publishing and going against the typical game. Noura was inspired by her internship with author and poet Astrid Haerens, where she was able to explore a multidisciplinary approach to illustration. The raw imagery, alienating soundscapes and embodied language create a dark, existentialist and immersive experience.
