This book offers an in-depth analysis of the structure and design of newspapers, with an emphasis on geometry, color, and grid systems. From a fascination with the visual complexity of newspapers, this research systematically explores their design characteristics. By using color legends, structures are identified and analyzed.

The book "Visual Structures. Grids, Colors and Insights into News Experience." presents an in-depth analysis of the structure and design of newspapers, with an emphasis on geometry, color, and grid systems. From a fascination with the visual complexity of newspapers, this research developed into a systematic exploration of their design characteristics. This book aims to provide readers with a better understanding of the underlying systems in newspaper design. Through color legends and other means, patterns and structures are identified and analyzed, resulting in a detailed overview of aesthetic and functional aspects of newspaper design. The book is structured around various case studies of newspapers from different cultural and regional contexts. By bringing together theoretical reflections, visual analyses, and inspiring examples, this work aims to contribute to the field of graphic and editorial design. It is intended for graphic designers, students, and anyone interested in the visual aspects and grid systems behind print-oriented news media.
