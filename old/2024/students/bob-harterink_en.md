"Through the Eye of the Maker" engages people with art. What is a better way to do that than to let them get started themselves? My project shows what I find interesting as a student, such as patterns, repetition and moiré effects. I want to pass on this interest by letting others experiment themselves.

My project revolves around three essential points: interaction, digitalization and a physical end result. I have a passion for patterns, repetition and overlapping, and have been working with these for years. For my master's thesis, I further developed these elements.

First, I investigated how I wanted to display my patterns. Ultimately, I chose the Axidraw, a machine that can draw lines on paper with great precision. After much experimentation, I arrived at a satisfying result.

Next, I wanted to give the viewer the same experience. Using NodeBox, a software program, I created a tool that allows you to generate the same patterns by uploading a photo. This tool contains parameters that allow users to create their own unique work.

Then I put everything on a website so that everyone has access. Users can send their creations directly from the website to the Axidraw and have their work made physically to take home with them.
