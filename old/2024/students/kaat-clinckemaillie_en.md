In a world where everyone is focused on their phone, where we decide on potential matches by swiping, where we snap, app, tweet and tinder, eye contact is often no longer in our vocabulary. With my project, Reconnect, I am trying to bring this essential element of human interaction back with the help of technology.

Technology and social media have expanded our world and increased our possibilities for communication. We are connected with people all over the world day and night. Yet the non-verbal nuances that are essential for true understanding, such as body language and eye contact, remain invisible within our digital network.
With Reconnect I want to bridge this gap and reconnect people with each other in a more intimate and meaningful way. What if eye contact were to become the primary form of communication again in our search for a match? With the help of a specially designed teleprompter, users can digitally look into the eyes of their potential matches.

Reconnect explores the power of non-verbal communication and invites people to re-appreciate and explore connection through eye contact. The aim is to create a first, unforgettable, intimate experience where a glance says more than a thousand words.
