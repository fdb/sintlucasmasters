installation exploring emotions trancending time


My artwork is an exploration of Jewish generational trauma, channeling my feelings and emotions into a tangible installation. I’ve created a kind of shrine to this trauma, portraying myself as an angry goddess surrounded by snakes and animals. In the center, I am taking off a mask, surrounded by hands reaching up, symbolizing the feeling of being suffocated, held, and grasping for relief. 

Within the installation, I’ve included different animals in my work.These animals symbolize mourning, progression, and the processing of deep emotions. This piece is a personal interpretation of generational trauma, reflecting my own pain, my family’s story, and how I navigate the world. 

In the middle, there is a video of me with my cat, a performance that signifies a peaceful acceptance and understanding of reality. This video acts as the thread binding the installation together, representing a harmonious coexistence with my heritage and the pain that comes with it. Through this installation, I aim to give my trauma and emotions a place, transforming pain into a visual and emotional narrative
