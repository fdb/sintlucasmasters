Narrative pillars are the revelation that serve as symbolic anchors to illustrate the stories of transience and the preservation of memories, where ruins represent as silent witnesses of a lived life in the shadows.

My art project, titled "La Révélation de Mes Ruïnes", is an exploration of transience, time and personal memories, represented by an installation of plaster sculptures. Through the use of plaster and clay casts, an archaeological effect emerges that reflects the fragility and temporary nature of existence. As someone who collects many objects, I integrate some into my work, giving it a personal and intimate dimension. Natural elements such as wilted flowers, symbols of transience and time, play an important role in my creations. The aesthetics of these ephemeral flowers inspire me and reinforce the thematic elements. My work embodies an ongoing quest to capture the cycles of life and the balance between memory and transience. The installation invites the public to pause and reflect on transience, the impact of personal memories. By displaying this layering and the fragility of the materials, I emphasize how memories are just as fragile and transient as the material world itself. Each piece in this installation tells a story of transformation and loss. "La Révélation de Mes Ruïnes" is an invitation to reflect on the endless cycle of life and decay, and how this defines us.
