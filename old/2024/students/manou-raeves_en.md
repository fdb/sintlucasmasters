The Feminine Archive Book is a book designed for the process of this project. This book brings together my personal collection of photographs and early development work, reference collages, influences, notes and documentation from my two master's years in which I searched for what femininity means to me — an intimate encounter with my creative process and expressed visual aesthetics but also between the important women in my surroundings and myself.
