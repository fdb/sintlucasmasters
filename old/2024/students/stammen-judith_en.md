An installation of three stories. One of the stories is an operating room nurse who accompanies an organ donation, the second story is a nurse reflecting on the final moments of people who are dying, and the third shows a video with snapshots of the daily life of a care worker in a nursing home.

Shift 121,50 is a moving installation that highlights three stories from the care sector. Each story offers a unique perspective on the daily reality of care professionals.
The first room of the installation brings the viewer into contact with the story of an operating room nurse who accompanies an organ donation. With a carefully set up video and sound fragments, the viewer is taken along on the intense emotions and professional dedication that accompany this experience. A bench invites contemplation as the story unfolds.
In the second room, a nurse immerses the visitor in her personal reflections on 'the final breath' of people. The intimate details and feelings she shares are reinforced by a carefully selected visual and auditory presentation. The bench in this room offers the opportunity to reflect on the significance of these moments in life.
At the back of the installation, a third story is projected, which highlights the daily life of a care worker in a nursing home. The video captures a range of tasks and challenges that care professionals encounter daily. This aspect of the installation offers a broader perspective on everyday work in care.
To reinforce the atmosphere of a hospital or nursing home, the installation is wrapped in building cotton. Behind this fabric, insulation has been added, creating a soothing environment that deepens the experience of the installation further. With Shift 121,50, not only are stories told, but a space is also created for reflection and empathy towards the people who care for others every day.
