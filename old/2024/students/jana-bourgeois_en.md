'A Handful of Daydreams' is a collection of colorful illustrations and texts that depict daydreams and the inner world. The project combines visual narratives with reflective texts and poems that bring imaginary landscapes to life.

'A Handful Of Daydreams' is the result of an intimate and therapeutic process of organizing feelings, questions and thoughts, and learning to understand them better. By expressing these experiences in a creative way, the project invites the reader to empathize and see how the world looks from my perspective. The project explores how daydreams and imagination can serve as windows into our deeper emotions, desires and quests. It is an invitation to start a conversation about topics that are not always easy to discuss and to promote self-expression.

The illustrations and texts create an atmosphere of wonder and humor, in which the reader is immersed in the dynamic inner world of my creation.
