The visual perception system is known to be selective. We process certain stimuli while ignoring other stimuli. This project explores how viewers discover different images by making eye movements visible.

In addition to scientific experts, artists have devoted centuries of attention to understanding the nature and function of visual experiences. Visual experiences, which arise from visual perception, are known to be selective. We process certain stimuli while ignoring other stimuli. As humans, we tend to be drawn to parts of images with high contrasts, details, and meanings.

The project "Blind Spots" is an interactive website that uses an eye-tracking tool capable of recognizing eye movements. By making the eye movements visible, this project aims to encourage viewers to reveal and explore different images in this way.
