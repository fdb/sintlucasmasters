"Figurae Botanica" is a visual work that immerses the viewer in a botanical experience and reveals unique aspects of the Hamamelis and Stewartia. As an imaginary researcher in Arboretum Kalmthout, Ellen Pincket brought these plants together in an idiosyncratic visual language. It displays a collection of plant elements that entice you to explore the fascinating world of botany yourself as a researcher. Discover the magic of nature through the lens of this unique visual journey.
