During the past school year, I pushed back against the rat race of life that everyone finds themselves in. Everything is moving so fast and people seem to have no time for anything anymore. Nothing can go fast enough in a time where standing still is considered going backwards. We fill every moment with something, especially in this technological age. We disconnect ourselves from place and space, as if we're momentarily in another dimension. The world we find ourselves in hardly seems interesting enough anymore. By filling every moment with something, everything seems to be moving even faster. There is no room to give our impressions and thoughts a place. It's a vicious circle with no apparent escape.

During my master's studies, I became very conscious of how we are consumed by society and by ourselves. All moments of rest, emptiness and negative space, I began to consciously recognize and realize what power lies within them. Something that is always present but which we never consciously pay attention to. It is in fact a luxury to be able to stand still and be fully present in reality. A world in which you feel your place in the present, because that is ultimately what really matters. In this awareness, analogue photography has taken over. A medium that demands time and patience, that forces you to be alert and look around you in the now. It is a conscious way of looking at the world and capturing images. It symbolizes taking your time, something that everyone should become aware of again and apply in their daily lives.
