A visual diary, inspired by the book of 19th-century American journalist and traveler Nellie Bly, "Around the World in 72 Days", in which I show the fragments and highlights of the world through her eyes. For this project, I chose a non-literal visual interpretation to depict her journey. Through an alternation of different styles, I wanted to capture the diversity of her destinations and travel in general.

What was special was that Nellie Bly was the first woman of her time to travel around the world solo and document it in her book. Because this story has become somewhat outdated, I wanted to make it attractive again by translating it into a visual and illustrative book, with the focus on images rather than text. With this, I hope to breathe new life into the story, make it more accessible to a new generation, and encourage young people to travel more.
