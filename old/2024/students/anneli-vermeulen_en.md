Silent skies is a book about a group of female combat pilots who fought on the Russian side during the Second World War. Informative pieces are alternated with a graphic novel based on true events. This way you discover this piece of history.

You read about Marina Roskova, the "mother" of the Night Witches, the founding of the group and the equipment they received to carry out their missions. You also follow one of their missions in the graphic novel and learn what happened after the war.

With this book I wanted to demonstrate that these women are part of history. They deserve as much attention as their male counterparts and should not be forgotten. History is male-dominated and I want to show the other side. They deserve the spotlight just as much.

As they themselves said: "be proud you are a woman".
