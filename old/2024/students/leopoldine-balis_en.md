Soft Fascination invites you into the serene world of nature, where mind, body and environment come together during meditative walks. This combination creates space for self-reflection and consciousness exploration. I have chosen to share this process with others and give them the opportunity to reconnect their mind and body with nature.

By allowing ourselves to be guided by visual perceptions and connecting with our surroundings through mantras, we create a personal and collective experience. The resulting cyanotypes serve as reflections that emphasize sharing this experience and promoting self-insight and connection with the natural world around us. In this way, we make our inner world visible and shareable.

The deep blue tones emphasize the quiet strength of natural elements and invite the viewer to pause and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us. With this project, I aim not only to inspire individuals, but also to contribute to greater awareness of the importance of a sustainable relationship with our environment.
