Since the advent of the computer, the world of book design has undergone profound changes. The digital revolution has brought new tools and techniques that make the design process faster and more efficient. But there is a risk that the essence of book design is overshadowed by the speed and transience of these digital tools. As a result, the ultimate goal—the clear and attractive communication of information—fades into the background. Digitalization also leads to a loss of tactile and material qualities that are essential for good book design. It is time to ask ourselves whether these developments benefit the quality of design. As designers, we have the responsibility to critically examine these design processes.

Therefore, it is important to return to the essential processes of book design. These could be found in the tactile and craftsmanship qualities of analog design. By bringing these together with the efficiency of digital design, we can create a process that embraces the advantages of both worlds. This master project primarily seeks to critically reflect on current design processes in order to return to the essence of book design.
