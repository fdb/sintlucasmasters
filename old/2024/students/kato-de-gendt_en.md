Step into the world of 'Zwip, the Circus Chick'!
An inspiring story that shows it's cool to be yourself, and in doing so, gives others the strength to do the same. A colorful picture book about embracing your own talents.

Zwip, the Circus Chick, is my master's project at Sint Lucas Antwerp. This book was created through collaboration with author Reine De Pelseneer. The message of the story is to show everyone, regardless of age, that it's completely okay to be yourself. Everyone is special in their own way, and by embracing yourself, you also give others the strength to do the same.

In my Bachelor's degree in Illustration, I focused primarily on illustrations for children. For my projects, I specifically chose this target group because after graduation I would like to continue working as a children's book illustrator. As an illustrator, I am someone who loves color and finds it very important. I enjoy experimenting with different media, and the fact that you can always continue to evolve is a major driving force for me. I'm always looking for new things to test and discover. In my illustrations, cheerful colors, animals and flowers often appear.

It has brought me great joy to illustrate Zwip's world, and I hope I can pass on some of that joy to you.
