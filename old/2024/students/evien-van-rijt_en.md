What is a childhood dream of food combinations? What do you eat when no one is looking? Through estrangement and memories, I want to return to the carefree feeling of childhood. The feeling you can still remember so well, of the birthday table the morning after the party.

I want to return to the moment when we had a different feeling about food. That's why I've drawn inspiration from childlike memories and fantasies. In a playful way, I create an experience that evokes the feeling of a memory, like when you woke up as a child the morning after a party and saw the leftovers from the evening before.

Through wordplay and subtle references, I process these feelings in my paintings and ceramics. Titles like "Lost French Toast," "Mud Cake," and "Dinner with Yourself." In "dinner with yourself" the title contains the number eleven, because I always work with recurring numbers. In this work, I've therefore incorporated eleven candlesticks, plates, and dishes. Numbers play an important role, which is why in the other works I've incorporated twenty-eight pieces of French toast on the plate and seven chips. The installation is a combination of childlike and adult objects, because memories are often created by ourselves and therefore can no longer be distinguished from reality. Is it a real memory or a creation of our desire?

Through the use of paintings and a ceramic installation, I want to evoke a forced memory. It's about a feeling of recognition and playfulness. What's your craziest food combination that you link to a memory?

It's a playful work with which I want to bridge estrangement. Do you dare to eat when people are around? That's why over the past year I've distributed chip sandwiches and organized a dinner with lasagne and applesauce, to ease the tension around eating habits.
