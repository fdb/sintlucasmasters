For my master's project, I focused on 'I'. I created various zines around themes that fascinate me. Ultimately, these zines were brought together in a book called 'I'.

I created 15 zines around themes that fascinate me. Some themes are close to my heart, while others are quite mundane. In these zines, I constantly tried to play with technique, format, print run, etc. Ultimately, I made a selection from all my work to compile a book called 'I'.
