Richard's project brings together multiple artistic collaborations.
He explores how structure works alongside spontaneity.
Participants take turns leading and following in the creative process.
The work is presented through performances, film and installation.

CONNECT, MOVE, DANCE: as we became material

It started with a simple idea: Richard rented a graduation artwork from an alumni through a contract because it intrigued him. What followed was an unexpected journey that proves art's power to create serendipitous connections.

Fellow artists became participants in Richard's artistic world, and he in theirs. That gesture grew into a complete reinterpretation, transformed into new physical and non-physical structures, videos, performances and experiments. The collaborations themselves became the raw material for new art.

The project explores art as a laboratory for switching positions where you can step outside yourself, experiment with different roles, and find breathing space. Rather than safe spaces, it develops something potentially more powerful: "safe selves," individuals strong enough to connect, move and dance authentically with others and the world around them.

Every collaboration is tested against three questions: Can anyone plug in? Does it bring something meaningful to those involved? Does it still read as art? This approach challenges artistic ownership while seeding new beginnings through transparency and invitation.

The work unfolds as: a filmed performance without audience, a walking jury review, and micro-performances where visitors co-create. An installation functions as a living constellation, displaying photos, videos, objects, texts, and clothing that document the collaborative journey.

Come witness how Richard and his unexpected partners all became material, and how collaboration becomes the medium itself.
