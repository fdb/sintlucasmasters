What if I were the last graphic designer? This Standard Manual proposes a visual system so rational, neutral, and closed that further interpretation becomes unnecessary. A guide reducing form to pure function.

What if I were the last graphic designer?
From that thought, I designed a Standard Manual that establishes a comprehensive, closed, and rational visual system. This manual imposes strict guidelines for typography, color, iconography, and layout, with the goal of reducing graphic design to its most functional, neutral, and objective form.

The project originated from a frustration: how few people are aware of the omnipresence and influence of graphic design. Initially, I tried to demonstrate this by removing design entirely from public imagery, but this quickly proved too radical. During my internship, where I worked daily within a visual identity system, I discovered the power of clear and strict guidelines. This became a turning point: instead of eliminating graphic design, I decided to tame it.

This Standard Manual does not center the individual or style, but the system itself. Form is entirely subordinate to function. Everything is designed to eliminate influence, interpretation, and expression as much as possible. The result is a guide that does not celebrate graphic design, but contains it a final attempt to neutralize the medium in a world where form too often becomes the message.
