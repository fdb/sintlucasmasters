In this master's thesis, the visual identity of the iconic, now defunct Belgian car brand Minerva was redesigned. Based on research and practical experience, this resulted in a contemporary brand guidelines that breathe new life into the brand.

For my master's thesis, I chose to delve into brands and branding, with a specific focus on visual identity. From my interest in graphic design and my experience during an internship at an advertising agency, the idea grew to design a corporate identity for an existing brand. The choice fell on Minerva, an iconic but now defunct Belgian car brand. This gave me the freedom to work creatively, without being bound by the limitations of an active brand.

Initially, I considered developing a full relaunch, including campaigns and advertisements, but it soon became clear that this was too ambitious within the available time. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on the core: the visual identity. The end result is a comprehensive and well-considered brand guidelines that places the Minerva brand in a contemporary context.

The new identity builds on the brand's heritage, but translates it into a sleek, modern and future-oriented design. The logo, typography, color use and graphic elements are all designed to create a coherent and powerful brand image together. Thus, Minerva, more than a century after its creation, receives a new visual life that connects past and future.
