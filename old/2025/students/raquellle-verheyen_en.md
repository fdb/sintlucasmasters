Raquelle investigates the unstable life cycle of everyday objects. These objects are assembled into compositions where the line between reality and the 'consumer dream' blurs. Drawing from vintage commercial imagery, she recontextualizes discarded materials to question how products are marketed, consumed and forgotten. Her assemblages challenge the promises we attach to things and the speed at which they lose their meaning.

Consumer culture is everywhere but not always visible.
Everything we produce and consume continues to exist, in one form or another. Raquelle investigates the unstable life cycle of everyday objects. These found objects, that once played a role in everyday life, are assembled into compositions where the line between reality and the 'consumer dream' blurs. Drawing from vintage commercial imagery, she recontextualizes discarded materials to question how products are marketed, consumed and forgotten. Her assemblages challenge the promises we attach to things and the speed at which they lose their meaning.

By reinterpreting advertisements and removing objects from their original context, Raquelle constructs a new narrative around what we consider ‘waste’ or ‘valuable’. Material leftovers gain new significance. Her assemblages become layered accumulations, they symbolize the abundance of products and aim to create a sense of overwhelming excess. She doesn’t just want to make a straightforward critique of consumption, but rather show how absurd and at the same time seductive the system is. And also the absurdity of the material and immaterial world.
