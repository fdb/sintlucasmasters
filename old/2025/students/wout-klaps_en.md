Through sculptures in textile and paintings, I investigate the symbolism of patterns, existing stereotypes surrounding these luxury fabrics, and bring these into dialogue with portraits that gaze back at the viewer.

Through sculptures made from wood and knitted textile, and paintings in oil paint, I investigate the symbolism and meaning of patterns and materials. My attention is specifically directed at existing stereotypes surrounding luxury fabrics, such as the contrast between the second-hand shopper and the 'wealthy' shopper, and how these stereotypes are anchored in cultural perceptions and social dynamics. By integrating these materials and patterns into sculptural forms that combine both textile tactility and the natural sturdiness of wood, objects emerge that already tell a story in themselves.

These sculptures subsequently enter into dialogue with paintings in which close-up portraits are central. The depicted faces deliberately gaze back at the viewer and actively direct their gaze towards the textile sculptures as well. This interplay creates a dynamic exchange in which the paintings observe the sculptures, while simultaneously inviting the viewer to remain open to possible interpretations of the symbolism, layeredness, and complexity contained within the work.

Within this investigation, I explore how textile carries not only aesthetic value, but also functions as a bearer of cultural memories, social hierarchies, and personal narratives. Through this interdisciplinary approach, in which painting and textile sculpture reinforce one another, space emerges for reflection on identity, status, consumer behavior, and the broader cultural significance of materials and patterns.
