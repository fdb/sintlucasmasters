I question the self-evidence of the bathroom as an intimate space through ceramic sculptures. Recognizable forms, color and material refer to their origin, but remain a suggestion. This creates confusion and objects that carry their own identity.

Through my work I question the space of the bathroom. Through ceramic sculptures I investigate the function and form of everyday objects from the bathroom. I manipulate their recognizable forms in a playful manner, causing their original logic to disappear. This creates recognition and estrangement: recognition because bathrooms are deeply interwoven with our bodies and daily routines. Estrangement because the objects are functionless and have no logic.
The bathroom is a place that is closely connected to our body and our daily routines. What does this space mean when its self-evidence is undermined?
I use materials that visually and conceptually refer to the bathroom, but they are not the 'real' materials, they only carry the suggestion of their origin. I question the self-evidence of everyday forms and investigate how this space is experienced: a place where objects lose their use logic, are manipulated in a playful manner and begin to carry their own identity.
