Sam Thys’ work explores the intersection of science and art through living systems. By integrating algae into functional installations, Thys creates symbiotic environments in which the organisms not only survive but flourish. These ecosystems become living artwork, dynamic, ever-changing, and responsive. His practice highlights the ecological and aesthetic potential of algae, inviting us to reconsider our relationship with nature and envision sustainable ways of creating and coexisting.
