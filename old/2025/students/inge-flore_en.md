Frontside/backside - inside/outside - 2D/3D - intended/unintended - transparent/opaque - intimate/political - panorama/sampler - garment/costume - functional/storytelling - ornament/content, this textile installation seeks the point where these opposites interact 
to reveal a reality and thus disturb the tense calm of the docile and the decorative.

Frontside/backside - inside/outside - 2D/3D - intended/unintended - transparent/opaque - intimate/political - panorama/sampler - garment/costume - functional/storytelling - ornament/content, this textile installation (made with soft, slow sewing, knitting, embroidery and crochet techniques) seeks the point where these opposites interact 
to reveal a reality and thus disturb the tense calm of the docile and the decorative.
I tried to develop a sensitive, committed body of work, where the private meets the public. 
I explore notions of language, memory, maternity, tactility and vulnerability. My work tends to be a gesture of emancipation, resistance and resilience. Intentionally, I designed a flexible three-dimensional structure (in wood and welded elbow pieces), that can be built up in different ways, for short or long periods of time...That flexibility is something I appreciate in the sector I work in, the performing arts. So I wanted a light structure, easy to (de)construct and where the internal dramaturgy of the canvases can be variable. At this point all the canvasses are mine, but I consider it as a work in progress where other works by me or other people can be hung at a later stage. I want to engage with other peoples reaction to my work, which may be verbal, performative or a complementary work that questions or expands the internal dramaturgy.
