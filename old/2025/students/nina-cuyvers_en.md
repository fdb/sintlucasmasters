HOW TO BUILD YOUR CASTLE is a mixed media installation that advocates the importance of play and imagination in adult life. As we grow older, we often lose touch with the playful mindset that once shaped our everyday experiences. This work seeks to spark childlike wonder by immersing the audience in a world that embraces magic, endless possibilities and creative exploration.
