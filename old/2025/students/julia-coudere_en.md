Exormist was created to question marketing in our contemporary consumer society. Often we are first convinced of a problem, after which we are later offered the solution in exchange for payment. With Exormist, I hope to raise awareness about this.

Troubled by that one annoying colleague, your children, or that stranger on the street? Maybe they can't help their behavior and are simply possessed. Procter & Gamble has collaborated with the exorcism department of the Vatican and developed Exormist. This revolutionary product, based on patented Neuro-Spiritual Diffusion™ technology, ensures that symptoms decrease within 24 hours. When the possessed person turns away from you, use the discrete format of Exormist and spray them on the torso.
