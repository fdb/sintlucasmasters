By experimenting with the boundries of two- and three-dimensional work, I question how memory and remembrance settles into objects. My practice moves between drawing, collecting and making; each work a way of mapping emotional traces. Referencing the aestethics of mourning jewellery and the power of relics, I experiment with materializing personal memories and emotions to process the importance of sentimantality and mementos to me as a jewellery maker. 


By experimenting with the boundaries of two- and three-dimensional work, Katja Jacobs explores how memory and remembrance become embedded in objects. Her practice moves between drawing, collecting, and making; each piece serving as a way to map emotional traces. Referencing the aesthetics of mourning jewellery and the power of relics, she experiments with materializing personal memories and emotions, reflecting on the significance of sentimentality and mementos within her identity as a jewellery maker.
