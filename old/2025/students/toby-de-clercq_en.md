An experimental comic story without a written script. On a distant planet, an alien egg is discovered. It turns out to be a source of life, but ultimately also the cause of destruction.

My project is an experimental comic story that comes into being without a written script. The focus is mainly on the images, the story is further developed while making it. There is less control over the story, which causes uncertainty during the creative process. Eliminating a script or any predetermined storyline also brings spontaneity to the story—often I only thought three pages ahead. Worldbuilding also plays an important role in the comic; it is essential to visually convey a fictional world well to the reader. Each page is drawn in A3 format and worked out exclusively with a crow quill pen and brush with ink. I place great importance on traditional drawing methods. The story centers on an alien egg. It is a source that creates life in the surrounding environment. A human comes across this egg, and others soon follow. The presence of these people shows their selfish desires regarding the egg. They take the egg with them, which ultimately becomes their downfall. The story is inspired by the power of nature and how non-native plants can disrupt or reshape ecosystems.
