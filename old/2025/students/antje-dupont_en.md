My work begins with walks in nature, where I create paintings based on what catches my eye. From these paintings, I extract lines, shapes, and colors, which I then translate into textiles. I work with fabric using paint and a sewing machine, in a slow process of observing, feeling, and repeating. Each piece becomes a tangible memory of a landscape or a moment.
