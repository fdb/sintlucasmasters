Rooted in the PFAS pollution scandal in Antwerp, this video installation explores the tension between ecological care and industrial toxicity through a personal lens. Consisting of a short documentary tracing the PFAS pollution scandal through conversations with my grandparents and others. Projected onto a mycelium screen, it becomes a multispecies installation where toxicity, memory, and resistance intertwine.

Rooted in the PFAS pollution scandal in Antwerp and a fascination for fungi, this video installation explores the tension between ecological care and industrial toxicity through a personal lens. The short documentary traces the invisible yet persistent presence of PFAS, so-called "forever chemicals," through conversations with my grandparents, who taught me about care of their land. Their garden, once a space of nourishment and trust, is now part of a poisoned landscape. The work critically reflects on the broader ecological narrative of "grow your own veggies" in a time when soil itself has been turned unsafe by state-sanctioned contamination.
Projected onto a fungal screen, the short documentary becomes part of a multispecies installation where fungal bodies, human memory, and chemical legacies entangle. Mycelium, with its ability to break down toxins and build vast, cooperative underground networks, becomes both a biological agent of repair and a framework for imagining and reimagining collective futures. It invites us to think beyond extraction, toward systems of mutual care and slow resistance. In this space storytelling becomes a form of resistance, an attempt to break public silence and cultivate new forms of accountability across generations and species.
