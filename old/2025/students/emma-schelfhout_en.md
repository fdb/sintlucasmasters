“My home is a sparrow” is the story of Jo, a 7 year old boy who struggles with loneliness. He forms attachments to objects and often loses himself in his imagination. Told in the format of a diary, the book gives an intimate look at how Jo copes with his feelings of isolation. When he meets a sparrow, the small connection becomes deeply meaningful to him.
