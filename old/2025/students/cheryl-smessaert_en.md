A discovery into my Ghanese side as someone with dual nationality, with a focus on Kente fabrics/patterns translated onto canvas

For my work, I have searched for different Ghanese fabrics with a focus on Kente fabric and have completely broken down this symbolism and history. After that, I extended this line to my personal experiences and created my work from it.

I find inspiration in the repetitive objects I come into contact with daily, and in the seemingly random places where they end up. My work is furthermore influenced by artists who explore similar themes through diverse materials and approaches. By embracing different perspectives and visual languages, I give myself the space to work more freely and playfully within my own practice. I consciously strive to create images that evoke a sense of chaos and curiosity.

As for color use, I usually opt for warm and bright colors that reflect my personality. I rarely work in black and white or with a cool color palette. For me, warmth and coziness are important – not necessarily literally, but especially in a figurative sense. My surroundings must also radiate a sense of warmth.
