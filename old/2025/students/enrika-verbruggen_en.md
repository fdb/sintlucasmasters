Connection, wonder and slowness: an ode to nature as guide, mirror and reminder of who we truly are.

This project is about the relationship between humans and nature. My research shows that over time, we have become increasingly distanced from it. Through the growth of technology and comfort, we have become less dependent on natural rhythms and conditions. At the same time, we have forgotten that we cannot control nature, but are an inseparable part of it. We are not an outsider – we are nature.

During this project, I began to look at nature in my immediate surroundings more consciously. I observed and listened more. I searched for the silent lessons that plants, seasons and ecosystems can teach us. For the symbolism contained in growth and decay. For the meaning of cycles, of rooting, blooming, dying and beginning again.

With this work, I want to invite slowness, to reconnection. I want to encourage the seeing and appreciation of the small, the seemingly ordinary. To wonder. To respect.

It is a search for our place within the greater whole. An attempt to realign ourselves with our own nature – and with the world we are part of.
