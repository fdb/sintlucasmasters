Handmade scent trees, crafted from fallen leaves and dead wood. With each one sold, the forest thins out quietly and gradually. A gentle reflection on our urge to own, consume and control nature. Limited edition forest: a reminder that real forests aren't endless.

Limited Edition Forest is an installation that stems from my outrage about how we as humans treat nature. Scent trees, made from fallen leaves of the American oak and dead wood, are sold as souvenirs. The more that are sold, the emptier the forest becomes. A critical wink at the way capitalism and human greed contribute to deforestation and depletion. The scent trees refer to the use of artificial nature in cars and spaces, while real nature is disappearing more and more.

Additionally, I invite visitors to write a personal forest memory on a postcard. These memories together form a growing collective memory, as an attempt to hold onto what is in danger of being lost. The combination of sensory experience, participation and symbolism is essential in my work.

What began as a quest for ecological material use grew, through personal detours, into a project in which my frustration and my desire for connection with nature come together. Limited Edition Forest is a work about loss, about value, and about how we try to hold onto nature in tangible forms, while it slowly disappears.
