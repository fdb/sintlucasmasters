"Caliburn" is a board game about the legend of King Arthur, which introduces the myth in a unique and interactive way.

"Caliburn" is a party game that is based on the legendary story of King Arthur. As a player, you take control of a squire who travels their way to the sword in the stone. Only those who are worthy can pull the sword from the stone. Throughout the game, you are introduced to all sorts of characters and locations from the famous legend.
The game can be played by 2 to 4 players. Everyone receives their own pawn and a helmet or hat, to which unique cards are attached that can only be used in combination with that specific helmet or hat. These cards often have deeper roots in the Arthur legend. For example, several characters are introduced such as the fairy Morgana or the wild boar named Twrch Trwyth.
The story of King Arthur has numerous variations, so there is much discussion about the fate of some characters. In the game, the characters are therefore not discussed in great detail. In this way, every version of the story is possible. The goal is to introduce the myth to the players and hopefully encourage them to investigate it themselves.
