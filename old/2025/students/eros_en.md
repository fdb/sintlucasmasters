The body is a landscape in erosion
mined, marked, and slowly undone by time.
Through sculptural gestures, I trace the residues of extraction and societal impact.
where matter unravels and memory clings to what’s been taken.

My practice explores the decay of the body in relation to processes of extraction and societal impact, both literal and symbolic. Through sculpture and installation, I work with materials that bear the marks of time, pressure, and extraction—such as stone, sediment, organic waste, and found objects. These materials are worked, transformed, and sometimes left to respond to their surroundings, creating layered structures that reference natural erosion, breakdown, and the re-emergence of form. Human presence is palpable in the imprints and traces, but never fully visible. My work approaches the body as a site where physical and mental landscapes meet as something that is displaced or exhausted. In this fragile in-between space, I show how extraction not only affects the earth but also strains and transforms the human self.
