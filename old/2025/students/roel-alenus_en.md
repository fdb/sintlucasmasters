This premaster project is an investigation into intersections between analog and digital. By continuously switching between a raster-based and wave-based approach, I explore images from multiple perspectives. Order/disorder, scale, matter, and time are the axes around which I have conducted my research.

In my research, I dissect (digital) images. There is a particular focus on a technical element of the JPEG image – an ubiquitous yet often unnoticed file type that visually shapes the internet. The way the image is divided into blocks of 8x8 pixels during compression, with each block consisting of a combination of cosine functions with different frequencies, fascinates me. The complex patterns that emerge from the interference of these waves form the heart of my research. These patterns are for me a kind of mythical, universal recipe from which every image can be constructed.

By switching between raster and wave, between digital and analog, I approach these patterns – and thereby image itself – on multiple levels. My research moves along four conceptual axes that I have determined for myself: entropy (order and disorder), matter (the interplay between digital and tangible object), scale, and time.

From this structure, I establish connections with broader phenomena and theories, such as interference, pareidolia, how AI 'sees', value transitions, and natural processes like reaction diffusion.
