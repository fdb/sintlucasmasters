NFC (Need For Contact) brings two strangers together to feel each other’s heartbeat during a conversation. What starts as small talk grows into a moment of real connection. A quiet moment where you let someone in, and a stranger becomes part of something shared.
Need For Contact invites people to meet with attention, vulnerability, and openness.

NFC (Need For Contact) is an installation that invites two strangers to meet.
Inside a reused AED cabinet, normally a place for emergencies, another kind of urgency appears: the need for real contact.
The cabinet contains technology that lets participants feel each other’s heartbeat from a distance, while they follow a gentle conversation. It moves from small talk to shared interests to reflection on connection. As they speak, they hear each other’s heartbeat: a quiet, human rhythm that’s usually hidden.
In a time shaped by screens and algorithms, and where social anxiety keeps growing, NFC offers something simple: two bodies, two voices, two hearts.
Here, technology doesn’t distract or filter. It helps people come closer. NFC is not a product or a fix. It’s an invitation to pause, to listen, and to meet someone as they are.
A moment of shared vulnerability. A quiet act of empathy.
