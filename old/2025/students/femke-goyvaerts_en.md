Starting from a personal fascination with absurd humor, I investigate familial dynamics and their visual translation.
The paintings are inspired by proverbs, family structures, and my father's deadpan language.
They depict recognizable interactions, balancing between the everyday and the absurd. A playful exploration of language, role patterns, and collective memory.

My work originates from a personal fascination with absurd humor, with my father and his endless stream of "dad jokes" as the primary source of inspiration. This lighthearted source evolved into a red thread in my research, in which I explored familial dynamics, role patterns, and language use.
In my paintings, I give visual form to proverbs and sayings, combining classic scenes from family life with alienating details and subtle humor. The scenes balance between the recognizable and the absurd, between domestic warmth and underlying tensions.
By interweaving language and image, I explore how humor functions as a binding agent within families, but also as a way of dealing with conflicts, misunderstandings, and hierarchy. My painting practice can be read as a visual diary full of winks at everyday life, where each detail invites a second look.
The result is a series of works that not only amuses, but also invites reflection on how we communicate, laugh, clash, and live together within families.
