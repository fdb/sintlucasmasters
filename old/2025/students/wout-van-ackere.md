In this project, Wout searches for and creates a rock star in and out of himself. He moves between honest self-reflection and deceptive projection, between performance and vulnerability. In this quest for an ideal self, he explores the thin line between reality and illusion, desire and identity. Imagination and playful honesty are not merely captured on camera to soften reality, but also as an attempt to merge the magical and the desired with the self.

In this project, Wout searches for and creates a rock star in and out of himself. He navigates the delicate space between genuine self-reflection and carefully crafted projection, blurring the boundaries between performance and vulnerability. This exploration of an idealized self reveals the fragile line separating reality from illusion, and desire from identity. Rather than simply capturing moments on camera to soften reality, Wout uses imagination and playful honesty as tools to merge the magical with the real, and the desired with the current self. His work questions how much of our identity is constructed through performance and how vulnerability can coexist with the image we project. Ultimately, this project becomes a reflection on the tensions between who we are, who we want to be, and how we choose to show ourselves to the world.
