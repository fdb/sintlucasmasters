"Tapir and Mombin" is a touching picture book about a lonely tapir who finds a small plant on the street and takes it home. The care for the plant slowly changes his life. He discovers new hobbies, makes new friendships and undergoes an inner transformation.

"Tapir and Mombin" is a touching picture book for children from five years old about care, friendship and inner transformation. The story is about a lonely tapir who finds a small plant on the street and decides to take it home. Caring for the plant gives his life new meaning: he begins to open himself up to the world around him, discovers new hobbies and makes friendships. The picture book contains 15 spreads with illustrations and includes a text of approximately 300 words written by me.

The illustrations were made using a collage technique, in which I combined printing techniques, colored pencil and watercolor drawings with old photographs and various types of paper and textures. The illustrations are textured and have soft colors that convey the atmosphere of the story. Thanks to their layered nature, they are visually and conceptually rich.

The book arose from my fascination with telling stories through images. I believe that illustration is a powerful means of conveying emotions and complex themes that are sometimes difficult to put into words.

With this project I wanted to show how important themes are such as feelings and empathy, loneliness and relationships, the complexity of the human psyche, care, a loving attitude towards yourself, and the ability to see beauty in the everyday.
