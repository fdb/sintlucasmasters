'The Great Little People' illustrates the importance of play in the different phases of life. Why do we seem to play less as adults? How can we make play part of our daily lives? Through playful drawings and a poetic story, this publication aims to ignite the reader's joy of play.

The drawings are a mix of techniques and materials such as collage, pencil drawings, risograph prints and screen printing. Besides in the book, the theme of play is also highlighted through smaller, playful publications.

Consider it a plea to allow more (traditional) play in our lives.
