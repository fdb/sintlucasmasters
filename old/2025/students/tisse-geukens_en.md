The Freshwater Safari is a treasure hunt at a local festival where children playfully become acquainted with the inhabitants of the underwater world of the Kempen. On their adventure, which starts in a life-sized, self-built wooden submarine, they discover the secrets of the Kempen streams, rivers and lakes. Here they learn all about the animals and their funny habits and clever tricks. They can then try these out themselves in the accompanying games.
In addition to the game, the underwater theme is further carried through in the design of the stage. A combination of murals and projection mapping brings the stage to life at night.
