My work stems from a fascination with muscles and their form. Not the perfect body, but the anatomy behind it is the focus. Sculpture and fitness meet in shaping and control. This creates a personal interpretation of muscle groups and fitness.

For my work, I started from my fascination with fitness. Not so much from a desire for a 'beautiful' body, but from a deeper admiration for muscles themselves. How they move, grow, contract, relax. The anatomy behind the body. I find the pure muscle form perhaps the most beautiful form of the body, away from the skin, the external characteristics but what lies beneath. What also fascinates me is that each body is unique from within. No two people have exactly the same muscle structure, just as no two sculptures are exactly the same. That's why I didn't want to create a perfect representation of the body in this work. In my sculptures, I determine which muscle groups I emphasize myself. I choose what is aesthetically interesting to me. Sculpture is just like fitness—you have control yourself, you decide how your body will look. There are also nods to the fitness environment itself in my work: the objects that lie around, the atmosphere of the space. For example, in the weights, the tense suspension system, and the choice of materials such as ceramic and mirrors. These elements also refer to a world in which control and feasibility are central.
