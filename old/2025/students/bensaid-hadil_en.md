In this visual investigation, I search for a new visual language for Moroccan-Arabic patterns. From my personal interest in pixel art and graphic compositions, I experiment with rearranging traditional elements into something that speaks to the present. This project is an ode to heritage and an attempt to break it open, towards something personal, something greater.

In my project, I investigate how traditional Moroccan-Arabic patterns, such as those found in zellige tiles, can be translated into a new, personal visual language. From a fascination with this rich formal vocabulary, I experiment with form, rhythm, and structure. By extracting elements from their traditional context and playing with them in unexpected compositions, space is created for innovation and free interpretation. Pixel art and graphic structures form important sources of inspiration here. The project is a visual experiment in which tradition and contemporary influences challenge and complement each other. I want to show that heritage is not fixed, but rather moves and can evolve. My ambition is to apply this visual language further in a commercial context, such as designing visual identities and packaging.
