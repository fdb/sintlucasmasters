A portrait is formed in the space between you and me, between model and artist. Portrait Cabinet shows how a portrait is more than one accurate image. How it can be a snapshot of the time spent together; A recording of two people.

A portrait is formed in the space between you and me, between model and artist. Portrait Cabinet shows how a portrait is more than one accurate image. How it can be a snapshot of the time spent together; A recording of two people.

Drawing as a medium allows an artist to capture a moment accessibly and at any location. Drawing asks you to slow down and pause, to observe carefully and remain alert in the moment. Further into the process, during a longer session, this flows into a natural relaxation between both artist and model. The space becomes part of the experience. The ambient sounds, the music, the objects nearby or the topic of conversation are all captured in the image. The documentary function and daily practice of drawing brings a consistent rhythm and a moment of reflection for the artist. It encourages you to be grounded in the moment through attentive observation and moments of rest.

The totality of recordings between the artist and a model forms a portrait. Portrait Cabinet brings five portraits together in a collection and invites you to step inside to record a moment yourself.
