A visual and tangible proposal around the word Páramo. Besides its meaning as an ecosystem, she also explores it as a political, emotional and territorial symbol.
An elastic and interactive alphabet with which realities can be written outside all extractivist and colonial ideas.

This project stems from my artistic experiment that wants to provide conceptual support to a visual and tangible proposal around the word páramo.

The starting point of this experiment is my personal experience: for thirteen years I conducted an anti-extractivist struggle against mining multinationals from a legal, political and communicative angle. Today I am forced to channel this struggle into an active interruption of that struggle, which I now dedicate to art as a form of care, remembrance and resistance, with a feminist and decolonial perspective.

A word that marked a turning point in my practice: Páramo. This word contains contradictions between the institutional and the academic, between the etymological and life on the land. I encounter Páramo this time not only as an ecosystem, but also as a political and poetic turning point.

I have taken examples of incorrect definitions as a problem case to address the distortion of the mandate and the "non-definition," as Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui puts it, of a colonial dictionary.

I am working on a proposal for an alphabet that, although it is in Latin script and in the Spanish language, contains an unexpectedly vulnerable elasticity through its composition on paper. By breaking with the rules of the language's grammar, so that it is simply letters in the hands of players who enter different floors and realities, tangible letters, which may or may not form figures, letters that form words that are not written from left to right, that do not yet have grammatical accents and that can even fall randomly and without hierarchy over others.

Due to the nature of the alphabet and the context it needs to be correctly interpreted, this proposal is performative, interactive and immediately generates new reflections. During my next master's year I will materialize this process in a short film that will enable the (audiovisual) systematization of the intention in the use of the proposed alphabet.

It is my goal to confront the colonizer and say: What are you going to do, now that the words and their meanings are in our hands?
