"Wa Make?" is s visual exploration of youth language and culture, translated through 3D animation, graphic compositions, and print. The project develops a contemporary visual language for an evolving, intangible heritage, offering young people new ways to express themselves visually within an urban context.
[The full project is on display in the photo studio.] <- enkel voor bijschrift expo, niet voor postkaarten.

"Wa Make?" emerged from the need to create a visual language that represents youth language and youth culture. It focuses on showcasing a living, evolving culture. The project can be presented through various mediums, including 3D animations, graphic compositions, and printed stills. It introduces a new medium—3D software—to transform traditional street art like graffiti into something beyond its conventional form. This approach not only respects urban regulations but also encourages innovation in how youth culture can be represented and experienced within the city. Ultimately, the project aims to contribute to a dynamic visual heritage that grows and evolves alongside its community.
