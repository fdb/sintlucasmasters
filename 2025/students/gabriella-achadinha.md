Deixem Passar (it favors the house) is a video essay that reflects on loss. Moving from Madeiraâ€™s sugarcane plantations to the diasporic spaces of corner shops and liquor stores in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa, the film traces histories of extraction, expectation, and the inherited weight of gendered [specifically masculine] obligation. Montage becomes a language of grief: a process of re-remembering and re-configuring.
