The Vlaanderenstraat is an ode to the modest front gardens so typical of our region.
I invite you to look with an open mind at what is peculiar, everyday, and familiar.
From a distance, these gardens form an unexpected artwork of shapes, colours, and rhythms.
For me, the Vlaanderenstraat in my hometown is the perfect example of this.

"Vlaanderenstraat" is an ode to the folk front gardens that are so typical of our region. With ceramic tiles and illustration, I explore how everyday elements, such as a garden gnome, a hedge or a concrete statue, can be transformed into something symbolic and artistic. The front garden functions as a kind of exhibition space, something personal yet visible to everyone. I invite the viewer to look without judgement at these strange, everyday, yet familiar gardens. When viewed from a distance, an unexpected rhythm of shapes, colours and repetition emerges. The Vlaanderenstraat from my hometown, which for a long time was looked down upon for this ‘folk’ expression, forms the source of inspiration for this work. With this ceramic interpretation, I want to offer a new perspective on these gardens, and at the same time pay tribute to their uniqueness and beauty.
