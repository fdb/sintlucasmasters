This video installation, projected onto layers of transparent textile, uses personal footage to explore the emotional, intuitive and sensory aspects of human experience. At the heart of this project is the idea that everything returns to the bodyâ€”that the body is a vessel for emotion, memory and sensation, carrying the weight of every experience. In contrast to the demands for speed, efficiency and productivity in modern society, this installation serves as an invitation to slow down, pause and reflect. Water appears throughout the work as a central theme, symbolising transformation, vulnerability, fragility, authenticity and human connection to nature.
