Creative expressions collected in a book, inspired by the orchid. A tribute to the orchid.

Orchid In my pre-master project, the orchid takes center stage: a flower that is both common and often underestimated. My choice for this flower was deliberate – I was drawn to its complex visual qualities and hybrid history.
The orchid is a flower with a mysterious character: seemingly delicate, yet biologically incredibly resilient. With roots in tropical rainforests, it has been cultivated and manipulated across the world. Its symmetry, the texture of its petals, and its color range – from deep magenta to soft white – form the foundation of my visual research.
What began as an experiment with printmaking techniques evolved into a deeper exploration of image and material. I gathered knowledge from biology and art history and investigated how the orchid functions as both image and object. This approach led to a book in which I literally zoom in on the flower – focusing on its form and color.
In addition, I developed a custom fragrance inspired by the orchid, to make the flower physically tangible as well. The scent is part of the work and enhances its sensory dimension.
With Orchid, I aim to create an ode to a flower often dismissed as decorative, but in reality complex, powerful, and full of layered meaning.
