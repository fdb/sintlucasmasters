When a person reveals herself on printed matter, images from the past might arise. Shifting through different portraits, altering poses, she lets you reach out your hand, hoping to connect — until you hit the plexiglass. In The Trick of Pose the archive becomes a stage, where, through the simulation of fiction, the life of artist model Audrey Munson is reimagined. 


When a person reveals herself on printed matter, images from the past might arise. Shifting through different portraits, altering poses, she lets you reach out your hand, hoping to connect — until you hit the plexiglass. 

In The Trick of Pose the archive becomes a stage, where, through the simulation of fiction, the life of artist model Audrey Munson is reimagined. Moving between art history, documentary and biography, the work suggests that a life cannot be traced. The distortions that emerge in reproducing a person’s life, are approached as a framework. Archival documents are unfolded into space, into interpretation, into a living archive. Feel your way through Audrey’s ephemera — to imagine beyond sight.
