This project explores sculpture as a perceptual and mental experience, questioning its existence in the viewer's imagination.
Sound, movement, and gesture expand the sculptural language beyond form.
The studio acts as both a stage and archive, where installations unfold through performance.
Tensions between clarity, ambiguity, and materiality shape the evolving process.

This project investigates the sculptural object as a medium for mental and sensory activation. Rather than presenting sculpture as a fixed form, it explores how sculptural elements can evoke imagined movement, spatial presence, and even sound—extending the artwork beyond its material limits. At the core of the project is the idea that a sculpture can exist not only in physical space, but also within the mental landscape of the viewer.

The sculptural works often revolve around the concept of the hole—not as absence, but as a form that invites mental traversal and imaginative projection. These objects are designed to trigger perceptual and bodily responses: they are not meant to be passively observed, but mentally and spatially navigated. Alongside these pieces, the project incorporates voice, gesture, and soundscapes, creating immersive situations where sculpture and performance converge.

The installation format rejects the neutrality of the traditional white cube and instead uses the artist’s studio as an active, performative space. Sculptures are arranged as distant, resonant forms, activated by the artist’s presence and by the viewer’s imagination. Sound is introduced not as a literal element, but as a conceptual force—inviting an internal listening experience.

Ultimately, the project proposes a shift in how we experience art objects: not as static representations, but as perceptual triggers. It invites the viewer to engage deeply and inwardly, opening up a space where form, sound, and memory intersect. Through this expanded sculptural language, the project questions how meaning is generated not only through what we see, but also through what we sense, imagine, and remember.
