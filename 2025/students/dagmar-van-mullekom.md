“BLACK” presents 144 colors that initially appear black but reveal subtle differences when studied more closely. By working with scale, context, and design, perception shifts and fixed color categories are questioned. In a world of rapid visual consumption, this work encourages a slower, more attentive way of seeing, drawing focus to what is easily overlooked.

“BLACK” is a project focused on colors that are typically perceived as black within our visual habits. It presents 144 shades that at first glance appear identical, but reveal subtle differences in brightness, contrast, and undertone when looked at closely.

By working with scale, context, and design, the work encourages slow and precise observation. Perception shifts as colors are taken out of isolation and viewed side by side.

In a visual culture where information is processed quickly and often superficially, “BLACK” invites viewers to slow down and reconsider their perception. The work draws attention to the subtle and overlooked, challenging fixed categories and assumptions about color.
