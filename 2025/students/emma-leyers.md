I want to show and reveal the double sided world of collecting video game loot boxes, Pokémon cards and blind box figurines. These all seem like a cute and happy experience when in reality they are a casino in disguise that can fill you with regret. Even though they are made out of cheap materials, like plastic and paper, they can be valuable objects which makes the hunt for the rarest item even more absurd.

I want to share the experience of collecting in and outside of video games. The adventure of hunting down all items that you want to have by completing missions or by buying everything with real money. The obsession to collect everything doesn’t stop in the virtual world. The amount of merchandise and goodies that you can buy from your favorite game is almost endless. I myself, like to spend money on digital loot boxes, Pokémon card packs and figure blind boxes. Those three are all systems where you buy a product without knowing what’s actually in it. I want to reveal how these systems of chance mirror the logic of a casino. Beneath the surface of playful design lies a manipulative system that enables addiction.
