“In Dialogue with Revolution” reflects my shifting connection to the student-led protests in Serbia, my home country, as I watch from afar through screens and social media. The textile works combine silkscreen prints with stitching, using repeated screenshots from a day of mass protest as a way to process, archive, and engage with reality through touch. Thread becomes both a veil and a form of repair, obscuring, revealing, and connecting. Though physically distant, I remain emotionally entangled, caught between the roles of witness and participant, reflecting on the fragile promise of direct democracy.

In Dialogue with Revolution explores how textile-based visual narratives can process the emotional complexity of witnessing political resistance from a diasporic position. I reflect on the ongoing student-led protests in Serbia, my home country, from a physical distance, navigating feelings of helplessness, urgency, and longing through screens and social media. These works combine silkscreen prints with stitching, using a repeated screenshot and fragments from personal archives like diary entries in audio format. The act of sewing becomes a way to process, to archive, and to engage with reality through touch. Thread functions as both a veil and a tool of repair, obscuring, revealing, and connecting. Though geographically removed, I remain emotionally entangled. Each panel evokes a different emotional state, echoing the shifting nature of my experience: some days the revolution feels vivid and alive; on others, it feels distant, fading, or already over. Through repetition and materiality, I explore how personal memory and collective action intertwine, and how tactile gestures can hold space for political presence across distance.
