The photographs are my way of answering, of placing their story next to mine, it's about how  a stranger's emotions can mirror your own and how photography becomes a space to hold those echoes.

This is an ongoing project based on letters I receive from people about love. I read these letters carefully, extract emotions that resonate with me, and translate them into images. The project is both a personal and collective search for the many ways love is experienced, remembered, and longed for. The photographs are my response, not as direct illustrations, but as visual reflections. Itâ€™s about how the feelings of others can unexpectedly mirror your own, and how photography becomes a space to hold and honor those shared emotions. Photography is my way of processing and connecting. The images that emerge are quiet, intimate traces of reflection: soft, slow, and open to interpretation. Presented in a spatial installation with printed canvas, the work moves beyond traditional photography and becomes an environment where emotion and memory can linger. In a world of speed and overload, I aim to create a space for pause, care, and recognition. Through this work, I want to offer small moments of softness, reminders that love is everywhere, in countless forms.
