Developed between Ireland and Belgium, this ongoing research project examines the complexities of interspecies relations. Falconry—the ancient practice of hunting with birds of prey—serves as a conceptual thread. Through this lens, Tremor reflects on collective perceptions of the natural world, questioning inherited systems of classification and control.

The title *Tremor* is drawn from J.A. Baker’s *The Peregrine*, in which he writes: “I came late to the love of birds. For years I saw them only as a tremor at the edge of a vision.” This sense of belated awareness resonates throughout the work, where falconry discloses a uniquely complex human–animal relationship in a time of intensifying environmental collapse.
