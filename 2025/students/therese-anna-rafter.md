Developed between Ireland and Belgium, this ongoing research project examines the complexities of interspecies relations. Falconry—the ancient practice of hunting with birds of prey—serves as a conceptual thread. Through this lens, Tremor reflects on collective perceptions of the natural world, questioning inherited systems of classification and control.

The title Tremor is drawn from J.A. Baker’s The Peregrine, in which he writes: “I came late to the love of birds. For years I saw them only as a tremor at the edge of a vision.” This sense of belated awareness resonates throughout the work, where falconry discloses a uniquely complex human–animal relationship in a time of intensifying environmental collapse.

The title Tremor is drawn from J.A. Baker’s The Peregrine, in which he writes: “I came late to the love of birds.

Tremor is the outcome of sustained artistic research, articulated through a book, mixed media presentation, and website. The current installation features photographic and sculptural works by Thérèse Anna Rafter. As part of the project, Rafter invited falconer Darry Reed to contribute a written text. She also received permission from François Lorrain to present his 2011 film featuring two Gyr–Saker hybrid falcons in flight. For this edited footage, composer Jack Colleran created a bespoke composition.
