I look at disintegration as a state of existence in the world. I try to capture whatâ€™s about to fade. Images made from dust appear through the light of a slide projector, a dialogue between light, sound and absence creates a fragile rhythm.

Over the past year, I've been working toward an installation, which originated from the question: What is the background through which we experience a work of art?

The experience is influenced by many aspects of our physical surroundings- light, smell, ambient sounds, and previous artworks- as well as our knowledge, evoked emotions and thoughts, and personal and psychological background.

I began to examine ways of setting a tone to the space, something that would evoke the personal subconscious of each viewer.
I was drawn to using fragile materials whose alterable weight creates a feeling of buoyancy.
The materials emerged from a feeling of discomfort and a subtle threat. I want the viewer to experience a sense of unrest and impermanence accompanied by the sharp, mechanical snap of the projector, while at the same time being mesmerized by the dust based images.
