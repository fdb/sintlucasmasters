Designing Arabic square kufic compositions requires time, precision, and rule knowledge.
To simplify this, I made a system that converts text automatically into square kufic designs.
To showcase its potential, a composition following the system’s principles was created from a poem I wrote, which reflects my creative journey.

My master’s project stems from a deep fascination with the Arabic square kufic script — a strictly geometric writing system with fixed rules, making the design of compositions a time-consuming and complex task.
To simplify this process, I developed a system that automatically converts input text into a square kufic composition, while respecting the traditional rules of the script. In doing so, I aim to provide artists, designers, and other creatives with an accessible tool to engage with this script.
To demonstrate the system’s potential, I wrote a poem reflecting on my creative and technical process. This text was visually translated into a square kufic composition, following the principles defined by the system.
The poem is also presented in Arabic, English, and phonetic transcription: making it readable for Arabic speakers, accessible for non-Arabic speakers, and approachable for those who want to learn to pronounce Arabic correctly without knowing the language.
