Engaging with cultural heritage allows traditional motifs to be preserved and reimagined. My work explores the dynamic energy that arises from composing historical forms and geometric rhythms. Inspired by Islamic art, the motifs were extracted from archaeological sources and simplified. Through an exploration of pattern principles, these elements have been adapted within the language of modern art.



Tracing and studying heritage play a crucial role in preserving traditional motifs. The goal is to keep these patterns alive and not let them be forgotten. In this project, historical motifs from the Islamic art period were extracted from archaeological sources, including historical manuscripts, ancient architecture, and carpets from countries such as Iran and Turkey. After simplification, the motifs were digitally recreated using design software. In simplifying the motifs, not only were the details reduced, but efforts were also made to design new and creative characters. By studying the principles of pattern construction not only in Islamic Arts, but also in other foreign countries, they were transformed into compositions suitable for use in contemporary art. In this project, attention was given to how each tile expands in different directions and to utilising elements to create connections. Since environmental design greatly influences human emotions and energy transfer, the composition, symbolic meaning and appearance of motifs have been carefully chosen to create a sense of positive energy upon viewing. Additionally, colours with an Islamic theme were used, very light tones, to ensure that the viewerâ€™s eyes are not strained over a long time.
