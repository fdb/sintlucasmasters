In the field of the changing, there is something unchanging. In the field of the form-full, there is something that is formless. In the realm of time, there is the timeless. In the strongest storm, there is a stillness. My practice aims to imagine what cannot be imaged: the astral,  the sacral, the Divine. Here, discarded materials are reassembled into shrine-like paintings.

Moasir Sieraâ€™s practice explores themes of mysticism, materiality, and self-realization.
Drawing from metaphysics and the occult, his work engages with transformation both of the self and the objects he repurposes. Found objects, discarded materials, wrappers of stimulants and possessions of the deceased find new life in his shrine-like constructions and textured paintings, bridging the physical and the unseen.

Gold is a central motif, often the most immediately recognizable element in his work. It is used as a symbol of ever-present awareness, of the unchanging stability beneath ongoing sensations and identities as often discussed by Eastern mystics. By integrating traditional gold leaf with golden wrappers of stimulants gold graffiti, Siera collapses the boundaries between high and low culture, underscoring the universal accessibility of self-actualization.

Through layered erosion, material reconstruction, and symbolic interventions, his works become portals where presence and absence come into union, and the ego dissolves into a greater whole. His practice is rooted in embodiment of the transcendental, as the physical act of making, mirrors the process of self-realization. By giving new purpose to abandoned materials, his work redefines belonging, both in the material world and within.
