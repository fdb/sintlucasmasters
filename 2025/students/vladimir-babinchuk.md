A choreographic installation confronting police brutality and border violence.
Three LED panels and a video expose the urgency to move beyond consuming violence.
The work proposes choreography as a concrete tool for resistance and collective defiance.
With Eleni Roberts Kazouri — from the performance Dark Waves.

Zones of Refusal is a choreographic installation confronting police brutality, border violence, and the politics of public space. Through a shifting landscape of movement, text, and sound, the work interrogates how violence is aestheticized, consumed, and contested. 

Two LED panels emit fragmented messages: commands, warnings, and protest cries. A third panel loops pixelized raw footage of police repression — while a screen loops footage from the performance DARK WAVES*, co-created with Eleni Roberts Kazouri. Movements are drawn from protest formations, tactical dispersals, and repeated gestures of refusal**.

The installation proposes choreography not as representation but as a way of rehearsing resistance. Inspired by contemporary uprisings and archival traces of past struggles, Zones of Refusal blurs the line between performance, signal, and confrontation. The LED signs become unstable carriers — oscillating between clarity and confusion, authority and noise — as viewers are invited to read and misread.

Emerging from ongoing research into the militarization of borders, state repression, and how the moving body is both targeted and mobilized, the work constructs a terrain of interruption — resisting spectacle, demanding presence, and calling for new choreographies of defiance.

* DARK WAVES premiering on 20 November at the MIR Festival in Athens.
** The gestures reference protest formations and the symbolic figure of Loukanikos, the stray dog who became an icon of resistance during the Greek anti-austerity protests.
