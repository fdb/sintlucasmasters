A ritual exploration of my ancestral heritage from Gran Canaria, Ukraine, and Greece.
Through performative gestures and natural materials, I evoke fragmented memories and lost connections. I invite the viewer to slow down and transcend borders as a political statement. By connecting with our body and the earth, we reclaim what has been lost.

My work, Shifting Landscapes, explores how heritage and identity become embodied and tangible through the body and natural materials. Rather than telling a linear story, I work fragmentarily and intuitively, drawing inspiration from landscapes tied to my roots: Gran Canaria, Ukraine, and Greece. Through video, voice, clay, and hand gestures, I create a sensory ritual experience where memory unfolds as a living, evolving process rather than a fixed archive.

I deliberately focus not on the familial archive, but on the bodily experience of heritage and history â€” aspects partly lost through diaspora and time. The audience is invited to slow down, connect with their own body and natural materials, and journey beyond social and political borders. This transcendence of borders is a political statement: in a fast-paced and divided world, I advocate for reconnecting with our ancestors, the earth, and our shared histories.

My practice balances installation art, experimental film, and social-ritual experimentation. The work activates a collective sensory experience where the fragmentary, performative, and material converge to revive memory.
