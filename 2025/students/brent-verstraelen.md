Temple of The Non-Useful questions how we assign value and function in a society driven by efficiency and progress. Born from a geometric ruin, it expresses fascination with the useless. An octagonal pillar without clear purpose exists honestly, inviting slow observation beyond utility. Its meaning arises from this lack of function, a pillar without a career.

This project centers on an octagonal pillar, 2.40 meters tall and weighing 400 kilograms, without function: no support, no purpose. The pillar simply exists, and in that lies its meaning. Originally, the work began as a geometric ruin but quickly evolved into a fascination with the useless. What remains when all function is removed? What is left?

Inspired by ruins and the power of time, I explored how time reduces structures to their essence: pure geometry that endures despite decay. The focus shifted from what ruins once were to what they are now: objects without function, yet with presence and strength.

The pillar is smoothly lacquered, precisely constructed, and carefully detailed. Yet I kept asking: why put so much effort into something without a purpose? The answer lies in embracing uselessness as an honest form in a world that demands everything serve a purpose. The pillar invites reflection, not by what it does, but by what it is.

This work is about presence, silence, and timelessness. It shows that meaning does not always need to be understood, but must be experienced. The pillar simply stands, without serving, and that is what makes it powerful. It is a Temple of The Non-Useful.
