The works in "Dad’s Flight Loop Trail" form a fictional topography based on a photo album of the artist’s father, which captures the Monument Valley area from his perspective as a pilot. The creation of the works revisits and nurtures the artist’s memories of this landscape through both her and her father’s eyes. The fleeting nature of memory is explored and made tangible. Since her father passed away during the creation of the project, the works also serve to preserve a part of his life’s journey. 

The body of work in "Dad’s Flight Loop Trail" form a fictional topography based on a photo album of the artist’s father. The album contains aerial documentation of the Monument Valley area from his perspective as a pilot. The act of creating these works revisits and nurtures the artist’s memories of this landscape through both her and her father’s eyes. The approach to the works as being fictional allows for an element of worldbuilding in which there is a cross-referencing between different works. The project explores the fleeting nature of memory and brings it back to being something tangible. Since the artist’s father passed away during the creation of the project, the works also serve to preserve a part of his life’s journey while addressing the importance of something that is left behind — like a photo album in this case.
