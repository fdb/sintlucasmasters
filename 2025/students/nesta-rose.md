Meditation, hallucination and tech in one trippy, self-generated experience. TripRig is a flickering light and sound machine, guided by your breath. Basically, getting high on your own supply.

This project began with a question:
Can I make art out of nothing?
As the year unfolded, that question transformed into something more alive. Nothing is not a void; it is a space of potential. In this project, I explored the idea that art might emerge from what’s already there—a breath, a body, a moment. The viewer becomes both the creator and the created, dissolving the boundary between observer and object.

The result was TripRig: a flickering light and sound device guided by breath. Influenced by tools like Brion Gysin’s Dreamachine and modern breathwork practices, the project blends meditation, hallucination, and technology into one self-generated experience. I worked with binaural beats, LED flicker, and breath sensors to create something that isn't just interactive—but reactive, alive.

What started as an experiment in nothingness became an invitation to tune in, breathe, and slip into altered states—without leaving your body.
