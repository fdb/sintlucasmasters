This work originates from the leftover material of old Letraset sheets. What’s often discarded or ignored, becomes the starting point for this graphic research. Through repetition, shifting, and layering, these fragments are transformed into a distinctive — at times uncanny — visual language. The outcome balances between coincidence and control, intuition and design.

“Transferred” is a project that began with leftover fragments from old Letraset sheets — broken shapes, dots, and lines that usually end up discarded. These remnants became the starting point for a new exploration.

The process was intuitive and hands-on: shifting, layering, repeating. Letting forms emerge through making. Analogue printing techniques such as risography, transfer and screen printing were tested and selected in dialogue with the material itself.

Rather than aiming for a fixed end result, the work unfolded gradually. The fragments evolved into a distinctive, at times uncanny visual language that balances control and coincidence, design and intuition.

The outcome is a series of prints, transfers, multiples, and a publication. Together they form a catalogue of forms that documents the process, without seeking to explain it.

In a visual culture driven by speed and saturation, this practice embraces slowness. It reflects on how we look, what we share, and what we choose to preserve.
