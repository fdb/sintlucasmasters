By reframing our understanding of weeds and our relationship with them inside the complex assemblage of nature, matter and humans, we can see them as a terrain of political conflict. Where the desires and needs of humans and nature are in contrast with each others. Weeds then are not about which species we classify as unwanted or undesirable, but about when the political agency of nature is in direct contrast with the way we see a space.

What happens then when we start to care about the weeds?
