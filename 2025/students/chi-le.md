Vietnamese people live with two coexisting calendar systems: Dương (Yang) calendar - the Gregorian calendar used in business, work, education, and daily life; and the Âm (Yin) calendar - Lunisolar calendar closely tied to observing nature, traditional festivals, agriculture, and spiritual practices. However, in modern life, this balance is shifting. The Dương calendar dominates, while the Âm calendar is fading compared to the past.

My project begins from that imbalance: between data and spirit, between what is regulated and what is felt, between what is encoded and what can only be experienced through the eyes and the heart. I do not reject data, but on the contrary, use it as material. However, units of time are not used for lookup or measurement but for contemplation and reconnection with an inner intuitive sense of time.
