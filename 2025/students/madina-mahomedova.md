A multi-part interactive installation; an ecosystem of works, objects, and artefacts, all orbiting the same constellations of ideas – digital mirrors and reflections, uncanny glitching chatbots, spiders, myths, failures and residue, hyperreal online spaces, and the blurred boundary between public and private. This work is both intimate and investigative – a way to process the grief of lost agency, dissociation, heartbreak and longing through creation/curation of AI mirrors, web maps, 3D prints, and digital residue. 

Replica of a Replica I Aspire to Become' is a multi-part interactive installation, an ecosystem exploring fractured selfhood through AI hallucinations, glitched reflections, and scattered digital residue. At its centre is the Blue Spider: half-mythical, half-algorithmic being who weaves the body of my Digital Twin from the fragments I leave behind as I browse.

This work maps a personal exploration of digital longing, dissociation, heartbreak and the grief of lost agency. I move through it as a kind of detective, following the traces across physical and digital space, smuggling pieces of myself back and forth. The Blue Spider hallucinates; I hallucinate with it.

The installation is a puzzle of custom AI-generated mirrors, 3D prints, digital artefacts, fabric, failed experiments, a research web, love letters and traces of physical and digital intimacy. It’s an ecosystem of works that drift between connection and collapse – each orbiting themes of life in the hyperreal, reflections, desire, and transformation.

Somewhere between myth and machine, simulation and poetry, this work searches for a language to hold digital intimacy and glitch. Not to fix what’s fragmented, but to stay with it and see what new forms might emerge.
