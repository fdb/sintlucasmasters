Life is built on delicate connections, intricate systems that depend on balance and reciprocity. Gaia.exe is an artificial biosphere; not one that mirrors nature, but one that makes its fragility tangible, embodied. Providing a space to experience how inextricably entwined we are with the dynamic, ever-changing networks of the present moment. A (dys)functional system in which presence shifts equilibrium. A reminder that all life is connected, and that every connection carries the weight of its own fragility.


GAIA.EXE is a constructed environment, a built sphere of interdependent and responsive elements. Not in an attempt to mimic nature, but to interprets its fragility into something that can be felt. Visitors don’t simply observe; by entering the space, they become part of the system, quietly shifting its balance and becoming integrated into its ongoing state of tension and response.

The installation resists stability. Instead of offering harmony, it reveals sensitivity — a system shaped by the quiet volatility at the heart of all living networks. What unfolds is not a spectacle of control but an atmosphere of vulnerability: alert, reactive, and never fully at rest. It invites reflection on how even the smallest presences ripple outward, subtly reshaping the whole.

The project offers a space to experience, through light, sound, and shifting atmosphere, the fragile threads that bind us to the biosphere and to one another. It reminds us that to live is to affect and to be affected — and that fragility is not a weakness but a condition of relation.
