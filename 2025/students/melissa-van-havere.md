In my artistic practice animals are central. With my work I want to question the current dynamic between human-animals and non-human animals. In this way I want to set a positive change in motion.

In my artistic practice animals play the lead. With my work I want to question the current relationship and dynamics between human-animals and non-human animals. 
With my work I’m critiquing in different ways how we’re treating animals in our society. The slaughtering and eating of countless animals, robbing birds and other animals of their freedom, killing insects just because they exist,… All the ways we harm animals like they are useable objects.
I use different techniques to bring my ideas into the world. Painting, installations, performances, objects,… You can recognize my work by the bright colors, humor and a playful, naïve style. I mainly use oil paint on canvas, ceramics, plaster and papier-maché. 
Experimenting is very important to me. Sometimes this results in imperfections, but it’s a conscious choice of mine to not always conceal these. To me, they’re an important part of the process and they can make an artwork truly unique.
The goal of my work is to make people reflect on our relationship with the animals whom we share this earth with. I want to raise awareness about the absurd and ‘inhuman’ way we treat animals. By addressing this in a lighthearted manner I hope to plant a seed of empathy, so the change can come from within. I don’t want to create shocking works that make people look away but images that encourage truly thinking about everything that’s happening.
