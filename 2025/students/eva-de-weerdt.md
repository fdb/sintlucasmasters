This project brings nature back to the city through images of the Hobokense Polder.
Displayed in dense urban neighborhoods where green space is scarce, we let the landscape flow into places where nature has disappeared. Hoping to spark dialogue on unequal access and the vital role of urban green for climate, biodiversity and well-being.

When The City Flows is a project that brings nature back into the city through photographs, collages, and etchings of the Hobokense Polder, one of the few remaining large natural areas in Antwerp. These works are placed in neighborhoods with high population density and limited access to green spaces, these are crucial for climate resilience, biodiversity, and public health. Yet in many parts of the city of Antwerp public green is scarce. By bringing these images into the urban space, we want to open up a conversation about the unequal distribution of nature and the urgent need for more accessible green areas in the city.

The Hobokense Polder, once flooded by the Scheldt and now a vibrant ecosystem, represents the "green lung" of the city. Through our images, we let this landscape flow into places where nature has disappeared, inviting passersby to imagine what urban life could look like with more space for plants, animals, and people to breathe.
