‘Adem’ is an exploration of the somatic experience of a dancer/human. Breath is an essential part of a dance practice, but do we use it enough? In this project, we tried to get as close to the body as possible by using microphones and GoPro’s, both attached to the bodies of seven dancers. It's an ode to being a dancer and therefore being vulnerable, thus human.

‘Adem’ is an exploration of the somatic experience of a dancer/human. Breath is an essential part of a dance practice, but do we use it enough? In this project, I tried to get as close to the body as possible by using microphones and GoPro’s, both attached to the bodies of the dancers. This all while dancing and exploring choreography and group improvisation. In this audio work I recorded the breath of seven dancers, all dancing the same choreography but in their own unique way. You’ll get to experience them all seven, separately, in headphones hanging from the ceiling.
Supporting this audio work, I made a publication with images from the rehearsals of the choreography. We used a GoPro to capture every step of the process. These cameras were attached to the body in many ways (on the chest, arm, leg, back, etc.). The images created with this camera are very alienating but also very dynamic. Nevertheless, they did not convey what I wanted to present to the audience. The feeling of rest and calm I experience while dancing was not visible in the videos. That’s why I incorporated the images in a publication as stills and not as moving images. In this publication, I also used words and poems of the dancers as well as my own texts I wrote during the process of this project.
