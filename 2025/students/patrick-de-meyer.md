Walking is not only a way to observe the world, but also a way to create art. In my case, by sketching or drawing the landscape from memory. Many artists see walking as a way to let the mind wander and open up to new ideas. It is a deep, sensory experience, a way to physically feel the world. Walking is a form of slowing down and quieting, a counterbalance to the speed of the modern world.
